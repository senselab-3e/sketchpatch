              <b>PREACCELERATOR POOL</b>
              <br>
        Procedures
        <br><br>
        The preacclerator  can be dipped into automatically and without discussion by anyone. It is a like a free radical funding fraction.
        <br><br>
        AMOUNT available: 15%  of each month's intake of funds, counting from the 5th of each month (the date we receive our Patreon contributions)
        <br><br>
        PURPOSE: The pool can be used for ongoing expenses related to 3E/ SenseLab activities.
        Examples are: materials for activitiues, supplies for SpaZe, or food expenses for a gathering. It can also be used to help lay the groundwork for the development of a proposition that needs preparatory work before moving further.
        <br><br>
        USING THE POOL:
        <br>
        1) <b>Inform</b> the group by posting a message on the Preaccelerator Pool Slack channel that funds are required and what they are for.
        <br>
        2) <b>Check</b> how much is left in the current month's pool by consulting  still.in.the.pool here:

        <br>
        3) Make the <b>purchase</b>.
        <br>
        4) <b>Upload the receipt(s)</b> and <b>fill in the form</b> found at:
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNdFUEqKGD2o6HOvTVSZYTaa_3DwtQKzZYS8LX-pJcevgWlw/viewform">add receipts here</a>
        Size limit: 10Mb. Suggestion: use a free phone scanning app like Scannable that produces small,  enhanced files, rather than using your phone camera directly. The form asks for total amount, tax breakdown (TPS and TVQ), and purchase category (from dropdown menu). It also invites you to leave an anarchival trace.
        <br>
        6) <b>Wait</b>. Once the form is submitted, an email notification is sent to the Preaccelerator Pool Slack Channel. Repayment is made by eInterac transfer from the 3E RBC bank account, using the email given in the form.
