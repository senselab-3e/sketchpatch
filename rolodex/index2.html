Those multiple centers of experiences are still linked to one centre of experience, as entangled multiplicities (56, 2018). I kept on thinking how this multiple center goes across, rather than linking to one centre which can be traced.

Invisibility not as an absence but as a point in which it cannot be seen through the bare eyes of neurotypicality (and when invisible creatures can be seen?). Invisibility is a productive device. A neurodiverse body, as all minor bodies, the black body, the migrant body, the native body, is always non-existent: it is not seen, parsed out of experience. It can still be felt, but for this the full feeling of feltverses need to be affirmed in the appetites.appetitive adventure is necessary, and 'passage precedes position'. <i>''On peut bien décrire les existantes comme 'jetés' dans le monde, invoquer leur ''être-au-monde''.

  <div class="box" data-content="I feel very spread out now that you are in Copenhagen. I couldn’t sleep for the past two nights, I woke up so early, which is vrey unlike me. I think it is because I’m still synched to your sleep and I sensed that you already woke up being ahead 6 hours. There are infinites of you and some are here with me and some of mine are there with you. That’s what makes me feel so spread out and accompanied by future spectres. Makes me think of that I sensed like a spectre of you was with me before I met you. Often meeting is more recognizing than meeting, don’t you think? Something is here again. We feel a lot the same. Actually that was the feeling I had when I met you. Not a meeting, but a recognising, and therein I found a calmness. I felt relieved, because I knew as soon as I met you I didn’t have to explain myself or clarify my presence. I knew that there was a mutuality, an understanding, which made me calm and reassured that bodies can be at places or in company without having to actively relate in the exhaustive sense -which is often in neurotypical settings a verbal mode. The relation was already established in the recognition rather than an explanation.

  <div class="box" data-content="Somebody on my Facebook just posted “Trauma is not what happens to us, but what we hold inside in the absence of an empathetic witness.” Do you like bad quotes on trauma’s on boring social media accounts? Everything about it is no. No to inside, no to absence, no to witness, no to empathy, no to the text, no to the quote, no to Peter Levine who wrote this, no the font. I like our font better, it’s called spectral. I’m glad that our texts are soaked in specturality, says more about ghosts from the past than any part of that quote, don’t you think?

  <div class="box" data-html="true" data-content="It took me some days to gain some forces to write here again, the Brazilian elections ate all my energy and I couldn't complete any single task for the past two days. In a certain sense, I knew that it was impossible for me to live there; not saying never, but right now the conditions are not favourable, independently of who wins in the second round. Of course I don't want the far-right candidate to win, but any result already established that a body that cannot sustain itself as the same body for more than two days (or two hours) cannot stay with all pieces together in a place that requires from you the constant positioning (in a sense of a subject that has to posit its views in a very clear and, I would say, typical way). I repeated many times that “Dougie Jones doesn't take position”. I guess another way to say what I want is: “Dougie Jones doesn't perform their position according to the signs expected by both the macro and micropolitical eyes”. I imagine that some people would think that both me and Dougie Jones are apolitical creatures. The issue is that their view of politics simply cannot understand that bodies are political and that bodies are what they can do; their affordances. Not in an essential way, I believe in plasticity, and I'm not also confining this kind of politics, I would say an animal politics according to what Massumi develops on his book, to the primacy of the experience. If I would, I would say that only those who suffer and experience the world not in the traditional way have voice or can talk about it. If that was the case, this world had already failed. But people believe in hierarchies of both discursive and bodily enunciates: in moments like this, all the energy must be focused on the “universal” well-being, an universal that is a world-selecting, a world that can fit all kinds of identities but not those who live in the thresholds of where I end and you begin: what would be the “performance mark” of those creatures, without having to pass through all the anxiety that comes with the faking performance of being a typical activist? That's why, of course I would vote for the left-wing in Brazil and I aim for their victory, but this world, the typical world, already won. I guess I'll have to stay far away from there for a while, visiting my cats, but not aiming to effectively live there." ><img align="center" width="185" src="img/image35.jpg"></div>

  <div class="box" data-content="I think I would prefer the octopodal mode of thinking through different tentacles that have their own desires, the lures that activate them... But I don't really think that cats cannot do that, or humans - or more-than humans (specially). The event knows itself to the order of what the event wants, and I think a good and non-translatable encounter like ours happens when the creatures that compose the event-eventing are involved in some tendencies that can have different modulations but still can in a way interact and input contagiousness generating a kind of movement that is a bit not-coordinated but that carries a strange beauty. I talk about all the versions of me that exceed my body talking to all the versions of you (well, maybe not all of them, I'm sure some versions of me may not like that, but they are infinite...or at least I think they tend to infinity.) And they have this thing that is like a council, but not through consent or something like that, or not the council of Ricks from Rick and Morty, that I kind of like but seems to be held upon very linguistic agreements of what needs to be done. Well, I see more like an orgy than a council, not paying respect to those really boring people that describe themselves as “super dionisiac” but are still attached to the whole body/mind divide… If they ever read Descartes… But there also some people that don't read Descartes and still contest him. Oh, I hate people, I really prefer the ghosts of me that “talk” to the ghosts of you, the ghosts of the future's past, or the past's future, something that has to do in a way with what Whitehead calls the “negative prehension” of an occasion or event that people who are too typical cannot really understand, but well, they have already all our jobs, I hope at least they give us the pleasure of understanding a *really* tinyyyyy part of Whitehead's ontological system.

  <div class="box" data-content="I love frictionous, or frictioness, or fricticious. Frictional, fictinal, fabulational. Fabulation is vrey frictionous, don’t you think? The versions of me and you writing, and capturing. It is a good thing that we have the same camera. It makes so much sense. I feel like your film roll was in mine, and I developed your captures, or we developed my capturing fabulation, or you captured our frictionous development, etc., etc. I want to wonder more about frictionous relating to fabulation relating to capturing. I’ll leave some space here to come back to that soon. Or you know what, I think we are already coming back to that by writing this. Also, did you see I included the picture of the spread-out tea, slowly falling out of the tiny hole in the bottom of the cup? What I like about that image is that it only works on a certain scale. If it’s small enough, it blends, everything backgrounding, but then when it is just a bit bigger, it expands, everything foregrounding by being blurry it never will. Which is beautiful, it cannot foreground because there was no specific capturing. I certainly do not think that enlarging relates to foregrounding, or that by enlarging something gets foregrounded, but for this instance I think yes, that’s the case. Or better, it tries to do so, but can keep on doing so because it will never fuelly come there. Imagine, the picture expanding and expanding, falling of my laptop screen, falling of yours, onto the picnic table, along the street onto the river bank, greetings the swans, into the water.
"><br> Could you live in a place with zero pieces of furniture? </div>
  <div class="box" data-html="true" data-content="I would love to be in friction with those swans and ducks, maybe feed them, not sure if I would like to feed them because they're already too much fed by the humans that think that they exist to serve their desires of cuteness, but I was afraid to interact with them because the parents of that child would find strange a 30 year old person interacting with her young daughter. It was funny, though, because there was a constant tension, I felt they were going to bite the girl really soon. On that sense, I liked that the parents let her feed them and go and be bitten, at least she experiences another less cute-human oriented version of animal politics than the usual servitude they expect from creatures that are not considered ontologically equal but as servants of guilty photographing. And I think the image of the almost leaky tea has this uncanny tonality not only, but also because of the camera used to take it… It's so funny that we have the same camera, but as you, I’m a bit tired of having it. It always fails in something, well, I like failure, but I think my Snappy is going to reach absolute failure really soon, I hope after I end this expensive trip to Denmark when I'll be able to finally buy a better analogue camera from eBay or find one in the group of traders. Also the almost-leakage of the tea reminds me of the leakage that caused your keyboard to act strangely, as the pores of your body, no? It seems that all machines are contaminated by this feeling of failure sometimes, and there's nothing we can do besides waiting. Them to disappear, break, or new machines to appear (what usually involves a lot of money…). At least your pores are working again no? Every time I end a paragraph I feel that I didn't answer anything that was commented before, but yes, maybe I have serious problems with linearity. Eventually those answers that are not answers but new questions will appear, or will have appeared in a future that is also a past. Is it future or is it past?
"> <img align ="left" width ="185" src=img/image15.jpg></img></div>
  <div class="box" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Spectres of the future are always visiting me. I wake up and they are already there. Sometimes I wonder if that virtuality of the future that decomposes me will really actualize or if there's no future at all without the right conditions… Well, I know time linearity is not a thing, what makes me live the future that will not happen in the future right now, and it's a kind of painful future. I wonder if with accumulation other movements appear. Movements that are not necessarily of accumulation but of dispersion. Like dispersion of the particles of textile every time I go to the laundromat, something gets lost, tiny particles of textile disappear by using, reusing, watching and drying everything many and many times. I know also some things are attached to them by contagiousness and cross-pollination of adventures in the laundromat, or the salt from the sea that penetrates my pores and my swimming clothes. But most things get thinner, like the sole of my boots, I really like the sensation of touching them and seeing that they're becoming smoother. You may have noticed that I do that oftenly. Repetition, or obsession, as some psychiatrists have said to me. I remember one of them talking to me that if I didn’t resolve the questions of repetitive behaviour I would never get a job. Guess what, I'll never resolve these questions because they're not really questions but just false problems (except that I may never get a job, which will bring more spectres from the future and things like that, but well, let's see). I really love new obsessions, saying the same words again and again and again. Of course each time it's in a different way but most of the people are not able to see that. You know I really hate boring things and boring people but maybe repetition is something that bothers those boring people or at least this kind of repetition that is less repetitive or in a less boring way for them to put everything into the neurotypical topology back again and smile like everything is okay and working… I couldn't continue to watch the Alain Resnais’ film after that. Well, I watched, but really bored. That's basic sci-fi rules that were not obeyed, not that I'm a purist or something like that, it's just that it doesn't make any sense, even if it was supposed to be a nonsense, it failed on that. It was more like a spiritualist film for me, in which the soul had to travel and see again and again what it did in a purgatorial way without having any agency - not that I believe in free will, but I believe in an infinitude of possible worlds.

VEYR

YVER
VYER

RYEV
YREV

good thing v-r-e-y has 4 different letters, because otherwise there would be less combinations ! if vrey had five letters it would be 5x4x3x2x1
nice no?
if we made a word out of the whole alphabet it would be 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8x9x10x11x12x13x14x15x16x17x18x19x20x21x22x23x24
but if we could reuse letters it would be 4^4

  <div class="box" data-content="Yes, I feel the same; a variation of the same - it's a nice feeling when I meet somebody and I don't need to jump into answering typical and functional questions like: “what do you do?”, “why are you living here?", or even “what are your plans?”. That one is the worst for me. It's so pleasant when I find somebody that I already know, or at least I know that I don't need to put things into words with my mouth because communication is already happening on other levels and strata. Language hurts a lot and flirting with language is a feeling that I don't know if I can still do. Since those things are said in different ways, and traditional objective consent is very typical and already a big restraint for the future of a relation (between bodies or anything). Really anything, like when people enter the room full of thingies and just put the chair back where it “should be”. Does the chair want to be there again doing its repetitive “task” and helping those really boring asses that need to work? Not sure if I am anthropomorphizing things too much but at least it's the way I get to understand what is wanted (or what can be lured without having to express a single word).

Yes vrey, I’m vrey into you. x

“It's vrey vrey nice to see you again, my old friend”

Did you see me typing?
Should images be added?

Yes I think it’s very important to have images be part of this.

Why very? Or not vrey?
You don't like vrey anymore?

Oh, out of habit. But apart from that I think just because vrey exists (and you know how much I love it), doesn’t mean very can’t be used anymore. Very is a different mode than vrey.

Also, it’s so nice to not know where something is taking, or should take. There are not a lot of places where a content does not have to be speculated before starting. Starting should start the middle.
Oh yes, that's true, and I just realized a strange thing, I couldn’t find references to Mister C saying vrey, then i put the scene description on google search and found a lot of reddit posts talking about it, but as YREV, so maybe VREY was invented, or manufactured, out of novelty, maybe he never said vrey but only yrev, that's very how it's pronounced on the red room language reversal arrangement.
Ohh ! That’s such a nice realisation. I was already thinking “how did the r jus jump like that”. But now that I know about YREV… ! Makes me want to record you saying very (if I ever catch you though… you very often say vrey lately) and try to play it in every different way...  very, vrey, yrev, yrev. 4 letters makes (4!), 4x3x2x1 combinations possible, no?

I love reversal speaking for recordings, to say vrey i would have to say yerv and then revert it with the audio editing tool. Yerv is a nice word no? We can record it on the bathtub, no?

Oh yes I love reversal speaking bathtub recordings. I’ll add some bathtub pictures too. I’m pretty sure we share a love for bathtubs.

  <div class="box" data-content="Not sure why I didn't remember this before, but once a dated a girl who had a partner that is a neuroscientist. Basically what he was doing in his research was looking into neuronal markers for autism and other kinds of “issues”, and intervene on them through electrical stimulation, in order to stimulate the development of ‘empathy’ and other ‘social skills'. I'm not going to enter into the discussion if the scientific research was valid or not, you know I hate people who dismiss science. And obviously not judge those who want to change themselves, if possible (the research apparently was not funded and ended). But just to think into the world-bodies that are felt as necessary by the typical activists: ‘empathy’ is a necessity, bodies that feel it differently or not feel at all are condemned to judgement in the parliament of Facebook. (Empathy obviously directed to another human subject or very well defined group).
