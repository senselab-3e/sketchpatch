        <p>Value is often allied to what can be articulated. What of the forces in experience that are felt but remain
            ineffable? What of other ways of expressing that defy articulation? What of the soundscapes that move us
            more by their undertow than by their waves? Duchamp's concept of the infrathin touches on this ineffable
            undertow in experience.</p>
