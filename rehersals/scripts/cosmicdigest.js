const emailThread = ['Chapter 1 Radical Empiricism Plane and Material: Pure Experience Plane and Material: Pure Experience One of the essential features of empiricism in general involves the construction of a plane that allows for observing how exceeding our limits, beliefs, judgments, and so forth are made. Experience is observed on the basis of a sort of pure experience, a ﬁrst moment of inexperience — the blank slate. For classical empiricists like Locke and Hume, this plane remains inextricable from human ignorance or newborn’s lack of knowledge, when the mind is still but a disparate set of psychic atoms without connections among them. Thus Hume asks whether someone who has never seen water can infer from its ﬂuidity and transparency that it will suffocate him. Rather than interpreting this artiﬁce in terms of a battle between Innatism and Cartesianism, we should think of this gesture in terms of the establishment of a new method. Of course the Cartesian method of doubt also lies in producing a tabula rasa of all forms of knowledge; the force of doubt, however, appears like the negative ﬂipside of the basic certainty that has not yet been discovered but is already is concealed, the “I think.” Put another way, Cartesianism does not truly entail a blank slate since it allows the “I think” an existence outside of it, which “I think” devises the blank slate and determines its ﬁnality. The advantage of the empiricist method is that it does not allow for anything outside. It begins with a plane where nothing is preestablished, where no form of knowledge, no certainty — even virtual — has yet appeared, such that everything has the right to be constructed. In James’s psychology, everything begins in the manner of classical empiricism. He calls upon the moment of inexperience: pure experience. At the time of the writing of Principles of Psychology (1890), pure experience is applicable to all states without consciousness. Examples are the sensations of newborns, comatose states, hallucinations induced by certain drugs — in short, any state in which distinctions are not yet made or cease to be made. If psychology only begins with the reﬂexive movement of introspection, then such states mark the limit of psychological investigation as such. “This stage of reﬂective condition is, more or less explicitly, our habitual adult state of mind. It cannot, however, be regarded as primitive. The consciousness of objects must come ﬁrst. We seem to lapse into this primordial condition when consciousness is reduced to a minimum by the inhalation of anaesthetics or during a faint” (emphasis mine). 2 What makes such states so difﬁcult to access analytically, is that they immerse us in a sort of “vague monism” in which we no longer distinguish subject and object, while the psychologist remains adamantly dualist. “It supposes two elements, mind knowing and thing known, and treats them as irreducible.” 3 The psychologist only intervenes as such when consciousness has already been distinguished from the object that consciousness posits before it, that is, when the object is known. The “empiricist” thus comes prior to — and grounds — the natural psychologist who is intent on describing the fact of consciousness in its duality. The empiricist tells us about the impersonal ground consciousness comes from, without being able to say anything about it. Such descriptions have their limits. By the time psychology steps in, pure experience is only accessible as always already lost. If we say that it is a matter of an experience without consciousness, psychology takes the expression in the most literal manner; it seeks the fact: at a sensory level, it is not possible to establish any distinction between consciousness and its object, either because consciousness is not yet there (the newborn), or because it is no longer there (fainting, drugs). Thus experience is pure because the one who has it is pure. Put another way, the plane is always reduced to a moment that is swiftly surpassed (and is embodied in theoretical characters, and ﬂeeting ones at that); psychology is no more capable than classical empiricism of deriving a genuine plane from these moments, which is to say, of establishing a reality co-present with all the data happening in it. In other words, psychology does not have a genetic ﬁeld at its disposal: either it traces backward toward pure experience as toward a limit yet encounters states too inconsistent to build its geneses, or it intervenes when everything is already constituted and has no other choice than to make do with already constituted geneses. It makes sense that Kant and Husserl, although guided by very different motivations, seek to constitute a transcendental ﬁeld beyond all psychology. In effect, the domain of the transcendental frees up a ﬁeld that allows for the constitution of true geneses because the ﬁeld has ﬁrst been puriﬁed of its empirical material and of the naiveties of psychological naturalism. We may go back to the pure conditions tied together by a transcendental ego in order to constitute a plane: thus Husserl may claim to have truly attained pure experience: “Its beginning is the pure — and, so to speak, still dumb — psychological experience, which now must be made to utter its own sense with no adulteration. The truly ﬁrst utterance, however, is the Cartesian utterance of the ego cogito…” 4 Oddly, however, no sooner does he reach this plane than he ﬁnds the same problem that is encountered in Descartes: the ego does not of itself make for the object of a genesis since it is, on the contrary, the condition of law. Pure means precisely that lived experiences are studied insofar they are immanent to consciousness. Transcendental philosophies free themselves well enough of empirical material yet nonetheless keep the forms inherited from psychology, even if they reorganize them to suit the requirements of their new domain. If, as we have already said, the ambition of James’s thought is to seize reality in the moment of its making, we understand why James cannot adopt either of these two approaches. He will neither pursue the material geneses of psychology, nor reconstruct the formal geneses of transcendental philosophies, for in both instances, even though every effort is made to follow the movement of what is in the making and to remain immanent to this movement, such efforts fail every time because the making is subjugated to preexisting forms that interrupt its very process. The real difﬁculty thus lies entirely in opening a third way, in establishing a pure experience that is not reducible to a pure sensory matter, nor constituted by forms of a pure subjectivity. What is needed are the ﬂeeting moments described previously, which can constitute a true plane of construction. This is what James attempts in Essays in Radical Empiricism (1904). In Principles of Psychology and subsequent texts, pure experience is only introduced within the framework of a psychological analysis or an epistemological description (which essentially means in terms of sensation). These latter texts present a signiﬁcant overturning the prior approach, proceeding in exactly the opposite direction: interpreting psychological analyses on the basis of the ﬁeld of pure experience. What becomes of subject, object, consciousness, and body from the point of view of pure experience? Dealing with them demands clearing the horizon of obstacles, to allow us to see how they are made. What must be explored are the movements that are located beneath the forms of psychology or inherited from them. We have the feeling of witnessing the birth of a new world. James’s entire enterprise lies in tracing back to what falls short of epistemological dualisms, back to where relations are given in a pure state, when they are not yet divided into any categorical binary whatsoever (subject/object; matter/spirit, etc.). It is a matter of establishing a new point of view. If at one time pure experience was manifested locally and punctually as it were, by way of certain interstices through which one caught a glimpse of chaos liberated by the matter of sensations (the dizziness of fainting or anesthesia), then, from now on, pure experience applies whatever happens, of any event, of a ﬁre burning, of a man reading in a train. It may even be applied to something entirely material, a chemical reaction. How is such an expansion possible? The general principle of pure experience is as follows: “Nothing shall be admitted as fact, it says, except what can be experienced at some deﬁnite time by some experient; and for every feature of fact ever so experienced, a deﬁnite place must be found somewhere in the ﬁnal system of reality.” 5 Pure experience is, in a manner that remains to be deﬁned, the universal That. It is the immense world of a non-qualiﬁed, neutral material. At the same it is “an immediate ﬂow of life.” Strictly speaking, we encounter nothing more of it than a bunch of “this” and “there.” And such terms are only conventions for signifying that no qualiﬁer, even as basic as “this” and “there,” can designate this universe. None of the pure forms of transcendental philosophies are to be found. James sometimes uses the term matter but in the vague sense of stuff or materials. Unlike empirical matter, material designates a reality that can be at once physical and mental. Put another way, there is nothing purely mental or purely material, rather everything is composed of physical-mental material. James may thus say of consciousness: “There is, I mean, no aboriginal stuff or quality of being, contrasted with that of which material objects are made, out of which our thoughts of them are made…” 6 This is a new version of vague monism. 7 Monism, however, is no longer a thinking of the All but of the interval, the in-between. It is a matter of an intermediary reality that stretches between mind and matter, precisely where they are closely merged, but on the basis of which they are distinguished as well, albeit only virtually. 8 We do not, properly speaking, yet make any distinction between them and yet we never cease to make the distinction. In other words, James elevates material to the state of true plane. He begins with the supposition that “there is only one primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which everything is composed, and… we call that stuff ‘pure experience’” (emphasis mine). 9 Pure does not here mean non-empirical; on the contrary, it is empirical, nothing but empirical. It is the datum in its pure state. It is no one’s datum. It is given in itself. It is not yet given for anyone; it is a world in which neither subject nor object have yet to appear. In this sense, we may speak of radical empiricism. Experience is therefore to be expanded in a very general sense: pure experience is the set of anything that is in relation with something else without consciousness of this relation necessarily being involved. Something of this usage of “experience” may be found in the French expression faire une experience or “to do an experience,” which means “to do an experiment,” for instance, an experiment on the crystallization of sodium and chloride. We are the ones who do the experiment; but the experience does not apply to us, it applies to what is put into relation: it is, in fact, the sodium and chloride that crystallize; as such, it is indeed they who do the experience of crystallization. Insofar as it is pure, experience may equally well apply to “subjects” as to “objects” (which is but a manner of speaking since neither subject nor object exists at this level).', "Hi everyone, HH (Halbe K), I'm replying to one of your comments: 7. Ok, more of a lot for me!. 'universal That', 'non-qualified, neutral material', 'Strictly speaking, we encounter nothing more of it than a bunch of of ‘this’ and ‘there’.' Well, I can’t say I follow all this, I relate the index of 'this' and 'there' to the comment on 'vague monism': 'This is a new version of vague monism. (7) Monism, however, is no longer a thought of the All but of the interval, the in-between.' This is that pure experience is an emphasis of the many relations of anything that is 'giving' not yet to anyone in particular. And the emphasis of 'this' and 'there' (which is not even enough to qualify this 'sort of emphasis') is an 'interval' of the 'vague monism'. I understand this 'interval' like a 'portion-ing', versus the 'totality' -of the monism. It is what is given of ALL the stuff of experience. And here something more about the 'interval' that refers to a comment of Mr. Andre Fogliano (Andre A). This 'vague monism' with its 'intervals', is an 'intermediary' between what is commonly called 'mind and matter'. And in footnote 8 it is said that the 'intermediary' is what accompanies and distinguishes (as immanently generates, I think) the 'distinction' between a reality outside actual consciousness and consciousness. Moreover, the footnote says that the intermediary is not something underlying 'matter' or 'consciousness': 'something intimately mingled with conscious life, interwoven with it, and not underlying it, as substantialism would have it.' So, this sentence on the 'intermediary' makes me think about the intermediaries that are needed to follow the temporality of our current political climate. The intermediary suggests that the movements are happening already everywhere (and elsewhere and then) and that they escape a 'root' or 'starting point'. So I guess we have to be launched forward (and backward- since the time of pure experience is not linear) with the intervals/intermediaries to find the techniques to capacitate the production of modes of living that move away from the 'laws' of transcendence and substantially. Those 'laws' that assume to know what the 'identity of experience' and thus a 'body', is. Moving away and forward (and backward) in such a way that the identity of experience can't be assumed (or know) and thus can't be prevented (or preempted) to move through intermediaries that capacitate further living.

I went there with choreographer Diego Gil and visual artist Siglinde Langholz. The Skyspace called 'Dividing the Light gathers visitors on benches beneath a canopy that frames a window to the sky. At dusk and dawn a lighting program bathes the canopy in changing colors, from goldenrod to turquoise, altering the viewer’s perception of the sky. One moment it’s a dreamy lavender, another it’s an ominous tablet of black. A shallow pool centered beneath the opening to the sky mirrors the daytime sky and reflects a dark echo of the night sky'(https://www.pomona.edu/museum/collections/james-turrell-skyspace 2017).In this installation, we were attracted to a corner in one of the benches. We piled our bodies in that corner, with our heads on top of some one else’s stomachs. From there, we were watching up, until our eyes started getting tired. We started practicing soft focus. The soft focus would start creating —in-relation with the installation’s durational sunset a blurring of the edges of the square that was the sky and the square that was the architecture framing the sky until suddenly for minuscule amounts of time all the edges would disappear, including the sense of our own bodies’ edges. This was a becoming sky, as we recall it. this moment of the blurring of the edges was so so crucial to the experience. in that moment there was this bathed experience of being in the taste of colorality. but there were these snippets of seconds where there was a indistinct parsing of what was going on. like a blending with. becoming and at the same time unbecoming, being unmade but then at the same time you would grasp this sensation only a bit after, once you were with clear focus again and retrospectively you would come to friends with the 'leaving' the presupposed separated oneness with which we carry our bodies so often. those spare seconds of unbecoming or feeling being unmade make me think of this 'state in which disticntions are not yet or cease to be made' have you ever experienced something like that? i think an mm usually experiences this when she 'stares' blankly to a wall. or nothing in particular. and also and mostly in the transitional moment of waking up. when not much is yet felt in terms of CONTRASTS. i also wonder if this installation can be experienced at all by DeafBlind communities?! is colour something that can be experienced in terms of vibrational INTENSITIES, flavours?'immerse us in a sort of 'vague monism' this makes me laugh. because an mm finds herself constantly in these states of 'vague monism'! haha.

I keep thinking of that poem and the question of the PRIMITIVE and somehow i connect it with this PRIMAL STUFF that James with Lapoujade gives us. and i wonder if this primal stuff. this what's moving beneath are not life forces. what has not yet been organized, what is in the sprinkle, or as 'ALWAYS ON THE VERGE'. so perhaps that becoming 'primitive' the poem call forth, has something to do with the becoming LAUNCHED forth-back-ward into a production of modes of living. which would be a BECOMING EXPERIMENTAL. and an mm wants to lace this even further with a feeling or weighting of the 'being present' moved by James toward 'becoming CO-PRESENT'. which would account for a politics of becoming ONTOGENETIC?! meaning perhaps, becoming-with, moving-with what's moving, what makes a difference, with contrast, moving THERE-THIS?! instead of moving with what otherwise FEELS 'imposed somehow over what moves beneath?', like learning to feel the difference and experimenting (exprimire-squeeze?) with that, to feel: does it move or does it tightens? to learn to move with what moves on the cracks of what's created at the limit of the 'constrictures' of/ (as Erin calls them) and the life's movings, that constant dance? in the way of the tiny absolutes. WHAT'S FELT! to follow those intervals?! i also like how the PLANE feels so close to the piece of rubber shared last week by James. 'WHAT IS NEEDED ARE THE FLEETING MOMENTS ... which can CONSTITUTE A ... PLANE OF CONSTRUCTION' a plane of experimentation, like an scrolling of the eternal scroll of 'doing something without knowing what it is that is being done !' walk for mm, dessert, lunch or nap. on the verge!", "So much here! First a set of definitions and then a reply to all the scintillating comments!!! What is empiricism? -a plane that allows for observing how exceeding our limits, beliefs, judgments - does not allow for anything outside. - begins with a plane where nothing is preestablished, where no form of knowledge, no certainty — even virtual — has yet appeared, such that everything has the right to be constructed. What is pure experience? - is applicable to all states without consciousness (any state in which distinctions are not yet made or cease to be made.) - Pure means precisely that lived experiences are studied insofar they are immanent to consciousness. - beneath the forms of psychology or inherited from them -' Nothing shall beadmitted as fact, it says, except what can be experienced at some definite time by some experient; and for every feature of fact ever so experienced, a definite place must be found somewhere in the final system of reality. - the immense world of a non-qualified, neutral material. At the same it is 'an immediate flow of life.' - the interval, the in-between - a stuff of which everything is composed - Pure does not here mean non-empirical; on the contrary, it is empirical, nothing but empirical. It is the datum in its pure state. - the set of anything that is in relation with something else without consciousness of this relation necessarily being involved.", "What is the difference between the impersonal and a blank slate (hh) 'I guess inexperience, so far, are the moments where one does not have the experience yet, does not know yet, or is not yet set in the knower known division even.' On purity: 'Experience always emerges in conditions. But then it is never ‘pure’ ?' >> pure doesn’t mean without anything else. It means with everything else! So as experience is reduced, it is less pure. Love this hh: 'Not matter + form, but rather material that is traversed by all sorts of forces which makes it empirical and more-than empirical, or radical, since it involves everything that makes a difference.' Andre, yes! 'what must be explored are the movements moving beneath' 'I wonder, though, what is the 'definite place [that[ must be found somewhere in the final system of reality?' – this is the reminder that pure experience is radically empirical (that despite its vagueness it must never be generalized – its conditioning of experience is always precise) A: 'how can we come to a procedure to trace back to the movements beaneath the subjects and objects that populates the plane where we are enmeshed??' I think this returns us to the multiplicity of the event of which we are always not one. So the plane includes our moreness. DD I love this! 'I understand this 'interval' like a 'portion-ing', versus the 'totality' -of the monism. It is what is given of ALL the stuff of experience.' DD/A on the sentence: 'and that they escape a 'root' or 'starting point'' as regards the political – I think this can really be felt with the global outrage at the moment. Racism has been with us, in us for so long. The protests are not about 1 dead person. The protests can’t be individualized. But their specificity (that they are happening now) does matter.", "Hi! Thank HH, mm and Erin for the 'inflexions'. I keep thinking with AA/AF about 'this' particular political moment through the 'interval' as an 'intermediary'. And I need some thought/help. For example, I see Trump's gesture to mobilize the army against the protest as a 'total' gesture. There is not 'world in the making' not a register of the 'intermediary events' that escalated to this massive and spread protest (this, there, here and elsewhere) but a full reaction. And I'm horrified to think that this gesture may look like a 'decisive', 'known' and 'clear and distinct' for Trump's supporters, and thus that it will raise his popularity. So, I'm thinking what would I do if I were an 'activist': how would I activate through that total gesture without another one to one total reaction? What would be the interval techniques that slide away from that total gesture? What would it mean in the context of a protest to 'interval' through the military presence/force? Would it mean to intensify the care for the intermediary relations, for the pockets of resistance spread everywhere (and anywhere and this and there)? DD", "Wow. Yes. The impossible questions. It always seems to me that in these times of escalated unrest (escalated in the sense that it is more vivid for those who aren’t always already living it) the grand has a real danger of trampling the minor gestures, and yet it is at the level of the minor that there is most elbow-room for change. I suppose we always fall prey (myself included) to the belief that it’s the big change that makes a difference. But the big change is often an empty gesture that has little effect on the qualities of everyday life. So much of what Brian writes about ontopower (power in the bare activity of experience) is so decisive, isn’t it? What the right has always known how to do is multiply and confuse at that level, to really work in the affective tonalities of the moment. So I am not sure it’s quite true to say that Trump works at the level of the 'decisive' though I totally understand that it feels that way. I think what Trump does is keep thinks off kilter so that content can move in more than one way in the abyss he creates (by opening up the field with the confusion he sows, more than one way of disrupting is made possible). So many people have written about the danger of the left remaining 'discursive.' We all know that all those articles stating the 'facts' make little difference. The affective tonality is shifted in the Trumpian lie in ways that have already recalibrated the field. The horror of radical empiricism taken seriously is that it shows us as much about how the right works as anything else… My tendency (always) is to say we need practices. We can see in this time that the practice of gathering makes a difference. We know that it foregrounds an energy that shifts the conversation. And it feels so vital to move with others in these moments. But as so many social justice activists have said, the ongoing work is where things can really change. It seems to me, DD, that your question/comment touches the durational quality of this ongoingness. As some of you know, I have written (in a moment of burnout in 2014) about the difference between the front lines and the sidelines. I have a sense that it would be good to be more involved in understanding sidelines. The sidelines have a different curve, a different temporality, a different ongoingness. Less frontal by nature, they activate momentums that may teach us something complex about how we (as an 'I') are not as central as we may have thought. I wonder here about something like PT that can’t be spoken alone. Is this a thinking of sidelines at work? Would love to hear from others. So much pain these days, and confusion about how to do this work. xxErin", "Thank you Erin and yes, decision is of the event. I was reading decision as that ‘macro’ effect the Trumps wants to create toward his supporters. And yes, I’m thinking the ‘interval’ as onto powerful, as part of an ongoing durational quality. I’m also curious to hear about other sidelines practices, such as PT can be. With care, DD", "A, I think 'I wonder, though, what is the 'definite place [that[ must be found somewhere in the final system of reality?, thoughts? ' simply means that it needs to be valued in and for itself, i.e. it cannot be seen as relative or lesser from a certain perspective or mode of existence. What is it to take really real a child saying there is a monster under the bed, to take that example again? To give it a 'definite place in the final system of reality', which are a bit fancy words for that I think. Then, 'I got the example, but when it involves 'ourselves', or our 'political climate', how can we come to a procedure to trace back to the movements beaneath the subjects and objects that populates the plane where we are enmeshed??' ahhhhhh. I wonder if we cannnot, and must not, think this 'we' as a making of experience as well, since all experience is in the making when following James' proposition of pure experience. Trying to think with the unfoldings of that. what mm said about the vague monism makes a lot of sense to me, I guess what James was saying is indeed that the boundaries of self ‘other’ world are not so clear here, they are blurred and that's where the world is in relation. It brings it back to the movement of the swerve or a resonator rather than a steady point.", "ah, John, Erin, what gorgeous messages. 'This is what really stands out in the US (and in Brazil at the moment). Every single gesture is about being and staying elected. And so nothing is really about'itself.' No statement is about COVID - it’s all and always about electability...It’s obscene.' I was thinking in these lines just yesterday, albeit with an example with far less severity I think (if it can ever be weighed). Here in The Netherlands there was also quite a protest against racism the day before yesterday, and far more people showed up than was expected. The consequence was that the square was packed - and this made it very hard, if not impossible to maintain the 1.5m distance rule. Though almost all protesters were wearing masks, it was of course a somewhat tricky situation. Now the backdrop of this event was a lot of consternation in the media by multiple figures, politicians and what not. How could this ever happen? How could these people do this, in these times. And how could the mayor, the first female mayor of Amsterdam might I add, ever allow for such a thing. Disgrace it was called. This made me think a lot about what this meant to condem such an event, especially when, in the days before, there were numerous moments where people ended up in places with far too many numbers already - beaches, parks, even a theme park got too crowded at some point. Yet for each of these moments there was little to no consternation (perhaps the first day the beach ran full, but after that it was just 'oh well, it happens'). 'Nothing is really about 'itself''. This is exactly what I was thinking, for of course it is not a favourable situation considering the circumstances with the virus, but why is this event, an activist event where people wilfully go to, particularly 'disgraceful'? For me the underlying systematic problems come to the fore there, because it makes one event (the beach) fall under the normal and thus does not evoke outrage, while the other event (the protest) is considered abnormal and thus subject to judgment. Not to mention that in the following it was the mayor who got the heat for it, because 'she should have prohibited such a disgraceful' thing. There it simply shifts from an underlying racism to a blatant mysogyny I feel. In any case, it seems that there is a sort of incapacity to see an event in and for itself, where it would be possible to say, 'yes this was not the wisest but it seemed very necessary !' or something of the sorts.", "I loved the line and the spiral play. We could say the a spiral is a line that got delirium? (is that make sense in english? In portuguese is possible to write that... there is a brazilian poetry, Manoel de Barros, that says that in poetry the verbs need to get delirium as when i child says: i hear the colors of a little bird). Kirsten, yes, I used procedure cause sometimes method is taken as a pre-determined category instead of a techinique that drops out throught the making of the experience…. Maybe procedure as an experimentation with method? John:'What is the fundamental difference between creating confusion and embracing complexity? Because we do want to appreciate compoexity, we want a caring that is sensitive and listens and flexible. That is very different from what Trump is doing, for sure, and one result Trump is hoping for is that people will become tired and want a simpler thing and will accept Trump as the simple thing, accept a dictator so we don’t have to think'. I think this somehow connects with the question I posed above… H: Then, 'I got the example, but when it involves'ourselves', or our'political climate', how can we come to a procedure to trace back to the movements beaneath the subjects and objects that populates the plane where we are enmeshed??' ahhhhhh. I wonder if we cannnot, and must not, think this 'we' as a making of experience as well, since all experience is in the making when following James' proposition of pure experience. Trying to think with the unfoldings of that'. I know, I know, we, ourselves, they are the most hard pronouns to take (worst than the I, because of a more political mark)… but the hard thing is to get rid of the hard crust that held the we together… right on the first lines of the chapter, Lapoujade sets the problem of radical empiricism (if I understood it correctly):'Pure Experience One of the essential features of empiricism in general involves the construction of a plane that allows for observing how exceeding our limits, beliefs, judgments, and so forth are made. Experience is observed on the basis of a sort of pure experience, a ﬁrst moment of inexperience — the blank slate'. This first momento of experience is where the movements beneath (and around) are still widly and bubbling moving from the epistemological dualism, Lapoujade underlines towards the end, I think. So that is why Erin´s insistance with the practice feels so right, to me at leats. It is there, in the practice, in the experience in the making, where we (?) can trace back (is that a good way to express it? Trace back?'the universal That. It is the immense world of a non-qualiﬁed, neutral material. At the same it is'an immediate ﬂow of life.' Strictly speaking, we encounter nothing more of it than a bunch of'this' and'there.' Maybe the definete place relates to this (mm)? Oof many many things… I am trying to understand DD and MM movements with the intermediary to map the momentum we are intertwined. Maybe yes, in ways that to scape this left and right dualism, we have to try hard to inhabit the interval, in a way to scape the violence through the left, but also from the left, to what Lapoujade read as 'the feeling of witnessing the birth of a new world'. There is still the touch Kirsten brought in… which can bring more complex to all of it… but it is time to cook!", "what a beautiful conversation. i think this is exactly why it is so radical and important to study what we're studying because it gives us leway to wonder how else other than the grand movements. i had these thoughts with me while showering yesterday and have been trying to compose an interweaving. let's see. for an mm a big part of the problem is to put things in an I or a We. Making it 'personal' or making it fall in a subject or subjects. Like this, with these movements, we miss to see that the problems are not necessarily on subjects or persons, although they subjectivize, but the problems are in strong tendencies. if we manage to see this with James' and Lapoujade's invitations, then we can see that all we can shift are TENDENCIES. and all we can do is practice ways. always multiple ways to shift, to open room for other ways. thinking of a smaller example can help indeed. an mm always finds interesting when a person says things like 'I AM THIS WAY, I KEEP DOING THESE THINGS, I'M MAD AT MY WAY OF BEING'. an mm tries to say, wait... the things we do, and we keep doing, they are TENDENCIES, they are not OURS, we can not be mad at us, TENDENCIES are movements larger than us. TENDENCIES are IN the WORLD, they are movements and movements compose ways. in this way of seeing things, you can not be mad at yourself for 'being this way' because it is not YOU that IS this way. it is the processes that a co-composed you-ing moves-with and has learned to move with. so the only way is to first liberate oneself from thinking that the tendencies are ours, yours. and then seeing HOW ELSE to move so that these tendencies find other ways of moving. what Erin calls re-orientations. this is what an mm calls: 'the only way is to howl' and there's no coincidence that the howling sounds similar to a HOW, this could also work in the way of saying: 'the only way is to how, this time in this determined definite place' this of course is super difficult because you also don't want to fall into a place where there's no assuming responsibility of actions. but the responsibility again can not fall all onto the figure of a 'person'. it has to also see what are the tendencies that propel and allow for these actions, so then, what other tendencies can be activated, practiced? now. practicing ways is what an mm calls dance. dancing with the forces that are active, moving into tendencies. because there's no way to just 'know'. things flip too fast. we can be crying and then the cry becomes laughter or vice versa. all movements carry tipping points and flipping movements that craft themselves in the movement. so we dance our ways in relation to the feeling of tendencies and the feeling of how the tendencies open or close, create or flip. move with the beneath - life forces or enclosures life, and makes an I or a We. so an mm has been wondering: what's the thing to do and so keeps attentive and tending with the feeling of things. like. what can we do? in an activist way as Diego says. mmhhh.. in reading Ken and Lori's text i love the way they call their text The Work After Our Rage 'a response'. they remind us this: 'This response is critical. It’s what makes the work possible. And it’s like a sprint. It increases our blood pressure. It takes adrenaline. It’s physically hard. It’s dangerous. And it’s tremendously urgent. Another set of responses happen at the range of effects and the set of relational concerns that arise from the specific incident or set of incidents: We look after each other, lift up black life, worry about our children, share information, resources and prayer. Each episode demands these responses and demands justice, absolutely. But when we dig into each episode as if it were an individual act, when we ask about the qualities and intentions of each victim and/or perpetrator, we go down a rabbit-hole of individuation.' so we respond. we howl. we how. i like to think when you have a situation with an angry kid at home for example. as a parent you may know ways in the way but there's never a 'right' way or just 'the' way. there's a dance of way-ing. experimental approaches. trying. attempts. THIS, no! this? maybe. this way? no no no! ok. maybe this? oh there... there there... something opening. let's keep practicing this way for a while. then something else will be needed. this helps me feel too. like this time with what is hapenning in the US, which mainly intenifies what's moving there already not only in the US. we feel and we move. we respond. what that looks like can be so different. we protest. we study. we re-consider police. we write. we invent things. for an mm for example what becomes urgent is two things. first. a relation to how to communicate this to kids. how to craft ways of living that can learn to recognize-feel these tendencies so that other ways of acting can be accessed, practiced. not easy. another way for an mm. two days ago. she so sad with the news. wanted to bury head under the ground. so much pain felt. mm crawled to a fabric, to a texture and made a piece that she is calling 'the war machine'. there was also a doing-with. 'we need pockets' to collect techniques. i know this so many times sounds like a game. it is truly serious for an mm. truly around the question of inventing other modes of life. the war machine piece has this quality of being a carpet that you can slide in. it was moved by a strong feeling i've being getting with this reading group around tunnels and experience other than seeing. moving other than moving a body. carving the space. becoming environmental bodying. blending with the environment. when the piece was done. an mm slid in there. covered her eyes, found her way to a kind of sleeve, to a kind of pocket for a finger, for another one. then a belt for a leg and wrapped it around. she wanted to become FLAT, become a plane. in there. she thought. This is it! we have to undo the fixity of bodies! we have to become more world, more carpet, more flat, but in the way that the flatness is a multiplicity, not a homogeneity. that's just an example. does this solve something? in a pragmatic way. an mm always having difficulty because these things some times feel so 'unpolitical', like they don't 'really' have the capacity to morph modes of life-ing. and yet she wonders? don't they? what is so scary of practices that don't produce grand instant shifts at a 'societal' level? and yet... some times she feels there's a hidden answer there... i think it is a lot in 'A Pragmatics for the Useless' from Erin that will be published soon.!? How else, still resonates. a small chants produces itself: 'Live differently!' Songs. Rhythms. To learn to hear-feel the rhythms i’m not used to. War machine in response to sadness and in the midst of the PT learning. How this moves at that level of movement of the concave and disconnected. How to make a stance to feel and say: i’m not a body! we are relational activities can we move more there?! Beneath—- at the level of the not yet recognizable. We can feel it while washing dishes. let's jump with those attunements. what calls? what suggests itself in the making? there there then try?! there won't be one right way. there's only many ways. attempts. Many ways. There’s no one way as in psychoanalysis where there’s a FIX. There’s nothing to fix or going back and fixing it, because it keeps moving. it keeps being produced. Perhaps there can only be minor shifts. Truly. Then: To unruly the fixes that are constanlty imposed over bodies. Unruly makes me feel of the 'abnormal' you were talking about hh. so perhaps we can keep messing with the idea of LINE. To get rid of the HARD CRUST. how do you open up a hard crust. you poke it. you dig holes, peak, beak it. scratch. knock. push. pull. brush. so if we can practice doing this at the level of virtual movements that tendencies are, then... maybe? a knee on a neck. this time. a fixing of a body. an inabilatation of movement. an asfixsiation. perhaps let’s unfix what has been told to us over and over that had a way a one way. Lets build those many ways more more more many ways. That for me is the politics of activism that can really make changes. Perhaps for a while at an imperceptible level. More dreams? Beneath with what’s moving at the level of affect. How it affects! This way ok so the. What we move so that affects are mobilized? Like a massage. There’s no ONE Way. No one response but to respond is necessary because it is movement pushing toward eventing. like lori and ken's reaponses. But what’s moving as a response. For mm many times, tears. Other times a need to hold from other possible universes to at least feel an edge of what else is possible. So she makes a pocket bookroom. She hides in there. She wants to learn to feel differently! So that she does not settle into form and then become one. Because that’s for her much of the stopping of movement and relation. It is not Trump who stops the movements. and yet it is. and yet also, mostly, it is large enormous tendencies that keep being fed and reinforced. Those tendencies allow for someone like Trump to do a militarization. For me the activism is in recognizing the tendencies but as we learn with James recognizing is not observing from the outside nor a mere epistemological knowing. Therefore mm’s emphasis in the dance, which for her is always there in practice. because a practice is ways. not even a one way. a practice keeps morphing, accordingly. so we dance the practice. dance is in no way bodies moving in space for an mm. dance, a capacity to move-with active forces, zigzagging so as not to fall into a one way movement that then takes the tenor of a grand. front-back-warding. mm’s dance is a dance with virtual forces. at the level of movements of thought. Sometimes she thinks people may think she spends her day dancing here and there. Disconnected with the world. But it’s not like that. The dances are with tendencies. Movement of thought. Feeling feelings autonomies doing things and the tapping into and with and co-composing with 'a dance of attention' that then allows for other movements beyond the I. For relational movement. It is not simple. It’s extremely difficult to practice. Also it keeps inventing itself it is not just learned and practiced, i imagine as PT. Trumps’ ways as tendencies move at large affect incredibly virtual. And as we’ve learned very REAL. sorry for the messy way of thoughts here. but can't in straight way for this one. hope it weaves in the necessity of what the question asks for! mm and of course the dance at the level of dancing with tendencies feels a lot like a WATER SLIDE! tobogganing and going out not knowing where exactly, then AGAIN!", "also reminded by Lili around these thoughts by Miguel D. Normabuena in a text-interview written with Paulina E. Varas Transversal Polyphonies: A Reflection with Miguel D. Norambuena on Félix Guattari’s Trip to Chile. i'm sharing some excerpts that i find useful in regards to this conversation, (apologies if this is too off topic from James and Lapoujade): 'Félix Guattari was a heretic and unusual psychoanalyst. His aesthetic paradigm in a permanent conceptual wandering, allergic to any oppressive transfer, forced one to constantly seek–as a work in progress–one’s own centrality, one’s own singularity, power, escape route. The terms, places and territories were slippery. I can tell you that there was an urgency to create ‘adjacencies’, to manufacture Invented Spaces, to build new subjective scaffolding from that peculiar Guattarian ‘healing process’, to create a positive alterity, in order to avoid being sucked into the melancholy and depressive paradigm of the exile. To establish a political, experiential and existential coalescence, where new life desires can be processed; and, therefore, to invent new micro-policies, all this being situated ‘in the middle’, as Deleuze would say, and from the heart of the oppressive capitalistic beast.' and then his proposition for a 'Daily Life Clinic'. I think this is a lot of the attempts around the 3 Ecologies Institute. Norambuena description: 'a villa with land to accommodate eight residents who were equally wary of current care initiatives. That is how I founded the Dracar Centre. This time, it was a house with land for gardening, a chicken coop and an orchard.' 'the ‘healing process’, is the production of relations, the building of relationships, accepting that people are as they are, and not as one would like them to be. In this context, both the individual and group activities that professionals propose, such as gardening, masonry, working with clay, drawing, music, preparing meals and walks (or doing nothing), are not ends in themselves, but rather that they constitute a means, an interface, a conjunctive space, a bridge, or an ecosophic, multi-material, heterogeneous and open agency, so that these people may, thanks to mutual trust, work in progress, develop, put into motion their life stories. Experiential stories that they rarely have the chance to practise. In this sense, the goal of the Daily Life Clinic and of the healing processes is to allow these people to move from one day to another and, according to the possibilities of each person, towards a minimum grammatical commitment to activities: transformation of materials, creation of reference points, and procedural transfers.' 'Gilles Deleuze always said that all these postures and developments, which are minor, minority, molecular, nomadic and adjacent, enjoy a fragile and precarious health. And this is due to the fact that they are permanently receiving requests, either from the inside or the outside, from a multiplicity of normalisation vectors. They are all more or less fascist, castrators of desire, of imagination, of innovation and of creation. Here, it matters very little whether one is on the political right or the left, alternative or environmentalist. These vectors of normalisation and micro-fascist and/or conformist subjective remodelling include all these identities and desires. The brief history of the Guattarian grid at the La Borde clinic is one of the many examples of how, even within an adjacent institutional, clinical agency, it may be broken down from within.' 'solidarity and social creativity, being able to escape this regime and its reductive nature is to support and create, wherever one may be, a heterogeneous multiplicity of machines of creation and emancipation of subjectivities, of social, political, aesthetic, nomadic and minor creations. To develop an entire micro-policy of care, of Invented Spaces, in order to overcome social and mental alienation, misogyny, racism, ghettoisation and gentrification.' 'Everything that is no longer, is this. From the ashes is born this other thing that is difference, power, creativity, desire.'", "Hey Mayra! I love those thoughts, which resonate very much with me. Opening up ways to create, without worrying too much about what is created! Love that! John E: YES YES YES YES The dances are with tendencies. Movement of thought. Feeling feelings autonomies doing things and the tapping into and with and co-composing with 'a dance of attention' that then allows for other movements beyond the I. For relational movement. It is not simple. It’s extremely difficult to practice. Also it keeps inventing itself it is not just learned and practiced, i imagine as PT.", "So many incredible thinkings…. I have been dwelling with John’s 'If Trump’s instinct is to create room and possibilities’ for a few days or hours… how it moved me to think was: what if what Tmp does is actually build rooms? As in,: he builds and reuses chambers as architectures of amplification. These chambers need to amplify each other on and offscreen. I am struck by his obsession with making things ‘concrete’: the wall, the need to have the Republican congress in a physical convention centre and for both these to be ample and for his tendency to continue to amplify them. While he lets the amplification go in many directions, he also always returns it back to himself claiming its surplus/excess for himself, cutting off relationality as virtual, or cutting off, as Lapoujade says' ’that everything has the right to be constructed’. Tmp is an empty concrete room with sound madly bouncing off its walls, waiting for the possibility of infilling it with more of himself….. ugh, that’s quite disgusting!!! xxA", "Was going through this bulging, delicious conversation again. Erin: 'On purity: “Experience always emerges in conditions. But then it is never ‘pure’ ?' >> pure doesn’t mean without anything else. It means with everything else! So as experience is reduced, it is less pure.' Yes! I think what I meant to steer at with that question is the paradox that comes with pure experience in the sense that any experience that is spoken of 'this' and 'that' is already no longer pure, so reduced indeed, but then how to speak about it? I was thinking that this is precisely the generative paradox to any practice, where it always exceeds its own form - in the case here that would be philosophy and its material the concepts, no? which is also again about the not knowing what is done, experimenting.", "we howl. we how.  an mm just tore right through me, through the whole day, with that. First an observation/question on the reading. Then I’ll spiral. ;-) I was a bit surprised that Lapoujade makes 'signs' such an important part of James’ philosophy. E.g. 'Pragmatism requires a new theory of signs' (from the intro). I was surprised because I didn’t see this concept/term come up a lot in what we read from the Essays in Radical Empiricism. Did I miss something? Does anyone already have a sense of why this is important? Does it perhaps relate to the notion of the 'intermediary' that has already been brought up by DD, an mm and Mr André Fogliano? Reading everyone’s wonderful thoughts, I felt the notions of the spiral, withness and being 'about itself' move into resonance. It’s pretty clear that Trump/the right wants to spiral public discourse out of control. What this conversation through James makes clear is that the goal of that outward spiraling is to destroy any sense of immanent withness/relation, including the relation to oneself. For instance, how often do we second guess ourselves before we speak up or end up not speaking up? That’s a specific goal of the right’s ontopowerful strategy, no? In a way, then, the outward spiral of polarization is already inside us, trying to impede expression and practice. (I recently read Ali Smith’s Boy meets Girl which has wonderful passages on this problem.) And the idea that nothing is about itself is also the ground for all that conspiracy thinking (which is a kind of rationalism on steroids). And this outward spiraling is a superuseful strategy for someone like Trump because, when no one (not even the right) no longer know themselves, Trump can issue order-words that allow his followers to fashion themselves a momentary self-assured subjectivity that is more like a persona maybe. But, it seems to me, that this conversation is also a spiral. The important difference for me is that it moves inward, 'proceeding in exactly the opposite direction' (to use Lapoujade’s words) in the sense that, like James’ radical empiricism, always insists on the (grounding? primal? immanent?) relationality that holds experience together - instead of peddling the fascist lie/illusion of stably positioned subjects. I think this inward spiral is pretty close to what Lapoujade describes (in the intro that we skipped) as pragmatism as method, and in particular a method for life or living or life-living. The intro articulates this as a matter of belief (in experience? existence?). I mention it because the intro, in a very moving way, clarified for me how radical empiricism is an activist philosophy.", "i always get a bit like those old casettes with a crack, with this paradox. how something is what it is both ways, in a settling into form, a reduction but also in a total not that, meaning that it is not the reduced but an ELSE, a singular esquness that does not fit within a reduction. i always like the example of feeling a BUMP, not necessarily touching one, but the feeling of an approximation of something BULKY, BUMPY. i love how the body exalts so fast, almost as before you get a grip of what's going on. so, you are walking down the street at night, your body jumps, the heart pumps faster, hairs in arms go sharp. a LUMP. an mm usually sees a GIANT FISH or a MONSTER. she jumps and almost runs. it takes almost no time for an mm to come to the reduction of 'ah, it's a garbage bag! what a relief! no monster... hehehe'. in spanish this is called, i had a SUSTO! it is nice. some people play to make a SUSTO for others just for the fun of the jumping of experience. in this examples you have that paradox i'm talking about. the GIANT FISH is what it is, in that glimpse of second IS a giant fish. IT IS WHAT IT IS. all the qualitative complexity takes a SINGULAR OCCASIONING of fishing gianting. yet at the same time. it is a GARBAGE BAG. It is also that. i guess that is the reduction you talk about. the settling into form. could someone elaborate, help me work further with this tickling example? it truly cracks my mind, always, again and again. like a WAIT, BUT, UH? Let's see if i can explain it further. In this example there seems to be a IT IS WHAT IT IS, which is REAL, that is not a reduction of the field? like it is ACTUALLY the field in movement, which is the giant fish. and then there seems to be a second moment IT IS WHAT IT IS now which is also REAL which is the garbage bag. Here, there's to ITs, one is what it is and another one is an abstraction, a subtraction? ok. HELP! hehe an anecdote in case mm's question is not that interesting: SMILE we used to make two teams. when we were kids. one team would go out of the house. another team would stay in and move all the furniture around and build obstacles and passages. then the team inside the house would hide and create ways to make SURPRISE experiences for the team entering the house after 10 minutes. it was so much fun. it was good that adults would leave us alone in houses for hours. we invented good ways of taking care of each other while PLAYING A LOT! juicy conversation indeed. miau.", "Hey mm: Love SUSTO! Your anecdote made me wonder if kids nowadays still learn how to take care of each other while playing or hanging out virtually. If it’s the same, or a bit different? Adrean and I have tended to travitate toward “diverse” or “ethnic” areas. Minnesota is home to several refugee populations, especially Somali and Hmong. We noticed that the parents sent their kids out to play endlessly without supervision, and that is wonderful. Other areas, the kids are more cloistered. Cultural differences? On another note, Im wondering about visual illusions. It seems it’s very easy for optical effects to occur. I am not sure about tactile. Maybe it is different, or maybe we haven’t had a language or mode-alignment long enough for things to trigger effects like that… I mean, if I touch a cold, grimy metal surface that is at a certain angle and of a certain solidity, I know or guess instantly it is a dumpster. It has no opportunity to be a monster first. Maybe it is because there aren’t many tactile monsters—but lots of visual monsters in popular culture, toys, cartoons, whatever. But it’s not to say that sometimes something doesn’t evoke something monstrous or scary in the PT realm. Maybe if a sidewalk’s angle drops and drops more steeply, for example, that can send signals and it does not feel safe—maybe it drops off a cliff! But going forward a bit more cautiously, relief that it levels out, or relief to smell water, river—ahh, so it’s a long descent toward a riverfront. Maybe that’s a tactile monstrosity for a bit there. But I’m curious what may be at play that seems to throw up so many optic effects so often for sighted people. Is this conditioned? Or inherent? How much of it is cultural? Do we humans have a need to make those leaps? Just a couple tangential thoughts! John", "Tippi, nice to think around the spiral. interested in this inward-outward spiralling. and also on the double edge of the 'second-guessing oneself and when no one (not even the right) no longer know themselves.' there seems to be a kind of 'self' in the inward movement. but then with James' invitations what is that without an individual and more an esqueness? I guess it is the same question i posed above, only different. the IT of settling into form versus de IT of esqueness. beautiful paradoxes presented! curious to hear more around this! mm", "Hi, Toni thanks for referring us to the introduction. I love the remark on the 'theory of signs'. As James says there, the theory of signs is in place to 'believe in the world'. To 'believe in the world' because philosophy provides the ideas, concepts, problems to act, and to create with and through the world in the making. (To believe that the encounter with an idea shapes minds and worlds). 'In this sense, pragmatism requires a new theory of signs. Pragmatism is not a philosophy but it demands with its every fiber a philosophy that permits us to act once again, not a philosophy in which we can believe, but rather a philosophy that makes us believe.' (page 8). I want to emphasize again the concept of the 'intermediary' mentioned by Lapoujade. Because I'm reading James saying don't run again each time something arrives in consciousness! There is a danger here to become a natural psychologist: 'In other words, psychology does not have a genetic field at its disposal: either it traces backward toward pure experience as toward a limit yet encounters states too inconsistent to build its genes...' (page 12). What is at stake is to experience the 'intermediary': 'James may thus say of consciousness: 'There is, I mean, no aboriginal stuff or quality of being, contrasted with that of which material objects are made, out of which our thoughts of them are made (...) It is a matter of an intermediary reality that stretches between mind and matter, precisely where they are closely merged, but on the basis of which they are distinguished as well, albeit only virtually.8' And exactly in the footnote 8, Lapoujade with a quote on a letter from Bergson to James says some more about this 'consciousness' (not to run away from): 'The existence of some reality outside all actual consciousness is certainly not the existence in itself touted by the old substantialism, and yet it is not actually presented to a consciousness, it is something intermediate between the two, always on the verge of coming into consciousness or coming back into consciousness, something intimately mingled with conscious life, interwoven with it, and not underlying it, as substantialism would have it.” In this concept of the intermediary and its graspability (conscious grasp, thinking-feeling, dancing-through/with) is where I see the link between the 'believing' as much as in the 'self' as in the 'big fish monsters' jumping at us at every corner. I think the ethical approach would be not to escape the register (consciousness of a partial mental something something and/or mental something something) of 'this or that', but of following the register as an 'intermediate register' (perception, consciousness). This means to follow as to create the thought as it is given by the threshold experience. My own ideas or a big fish jumping at me: the ethical step is to keep sliding with them, 'thresholding' through 'intermediate' states: bring the experience forward to intermediate states with the world, but not be afraid of killing it because now you know what it is about! Do you, anyways, know what it is about and that it is in or of yourself? To move through the threshold of intermediate consciousness is to register techniques for the world in the making and to believe in it. DD (ps: I know too much text... ", "I like that, mm, and agree that a singular esqueness of experience is a better way to describe the consistency of an individual or a 'self'. Following that, I would say that Trump’s strategy is to keep that esqueness from becoming conscious to their 'selves', to internally divide people and create uncertainty so that his speech/tweets comes as little injections of relieving certainty (for his followers) in lieu of self-affirmation. That’s the ontopowerful side of authoritarianism. And yes, that’s not very different from constantly second-guessing oneself on the left or wherever, so that you wait for others to say the thing you can affirm (phew! relief! clap!) instead of saying it yourself. This could be linked back to the point that radical empiricism is not a moral philosophy. The process of polarization itself is morally/politically neutral and might catch our esquenesses in similar ways, regardless of where we are on the political spectrum. But of course that does not mean that the 'practical consequences' of that polarization are the same across the political spectrum. Thinking in those terms, I guess the pragmatic question is: How do you reverse a spiral? And now my hunch would be that it starts with the esqueness. To make it more concrete: Erin mentioned burnout earlier which I also have experiences with. Getting out of the burnout was/is really like reversing an entire spiral of existence. And the moment you can start doing that is when you dare to affirm your esqueness again. But the whole process of reversing the spiral takes years!", "DD, not too much text, just perfect, to work through the INTERMEDIARY feeling that keeps coming through the movements of articulating collectively. LOVE the intermediary in this way! mm's intermediaries of experience are indeed so full of giant fishes and giant rocks falling from the sky! immense masses of the unkown. yeh we can kill 'em. mm likes to talk to them. once she finds they are friendly endevours of the world; devourers of the lineal experience. they keep eating pieces of the so-thought-LINE. once she finds them harmless realitites, actually mostly making life much more livable than what supposedly IS just there. hehe! weeewooooreeee. JOY! Oof. beautiful. I think this may be a beautiful technique (love that figure.): 'TO REVERSE THE SPIRAL: affirming the esqueness again and again' mm, I was thinking that for me are 'small dwarfs', they are horrible but funny, the runaway at every corner and in many front gardens while I walk with Cactus (my dog) DD", "I want to respond to so many things!!! This one is a thought for johmmmmm. Smile! mm, when you talk about the feeling of the world, the edgings into itself - the itness - and foreground how it grows into its itness often in ways that are not clearly mappable onto it-self (the lump-monster) and then John says - the dumpster reveals itself as dumpster and asks whether touch can actually do that work that vision does. I’ve been puzzling over it all afternoon. I’ll take a risk and John, go ahead and correct!! In Brian’s book Parables for the Virtual, Brian challenged the claims of ocularcentrism that were standard at that time (in the late 1990s and early 2000s). So many books came out in that period that sidelined the visual in lieu of other senses (often replaying the same hierarchies with other senses). In fact, that’s also how I started Politics of Touch (which I wrote most of before meeting Brian). I also was certain that we needed to move toward touch because of our central allegiance to vision. But slowly as I wrote I shifted my perspective, uncertain that the way people talked about ocularcentrism really shifted much in the conversation around the senses. And then I read Parables (still before meeting Brian) and was completely floored. What Brian was giving us was a completely different account of how we sense (coming, as I know now from Process Philosophy). Brian’s main claim is that vision is never reducible to the eyes. He of course says this much more beautifully. What he demonstrates over several chapters is that sensation is amodal - it moves across sense receptors in ways that are irreducible to one sense. To touch for folks who use vision is to activate a field that is neither fully reducible to vision nor to touch. It happens in the between. We who see with our eyes are already touching before our hand reaches the object. My main concept in Politics of Touch is reaching-toward. What shifted my perspective on ocularcentrism is that I couldn’t completely separate touch from other senses, and especially - I couldn’t separate it from movement. I came to this viewpoint when I realized that the touch-surface desensitizes through prolonged contact and so to feel the world we touch again. Movement is key. This much I knew before I read Parables. What Parables gave me was a way to think about the senses without reducing them to what in philosophy is called “sense presentation” - the organs of sense. Sensing is always in the radical! Sensing is in the world, not in the thing. The thing activates that world and the relay is what we call sense. So mm it makes total sense to me (ha!) that you describe experience as occurring in that between. And knowing you I also know that your neurodiversity (like so many) comes with a preference toward experience which is decidedly not visual in its parsing. But, and here I need you John!, what happens amodally when vision is not available? What are the currents through which sense radicalizes? Maybe, John, metatactility as you define it (which, for those who don’t know John’s work, is the ProTactile account of touch that exceeds the limited notion of hands-on touch to include a sense of touching the world or being touched by the world) - maybe carries this doubleness? What I mean by that is that perhaps touch amodally connects to metatactility ? What I am thinking of is an example you once gave me of the feet as feelers going down the stairs. You said (and I am paraphrasing) that they needed to engage the world in two ways - as stilts and feelers. And if they moved too much toward feelers, well, that could mean a tumble! Would it make sense to suggest that a training in metatactility (as operative through practicing ProTactile, say) allows for this doubleness whereby the dumpster can be known (for the sake of navigation, say) as a dumpster but could also be known more speculatively if the conditions are such that the environment can handle it? I mean: if the body is anguished at the experience of navigating its feelers will be honed such as to limit experience to the range of expected affordances (walls, sidewalk cuts, fences, trees, dumpsters etc). The path is laid out in a way that the terminus must be more reliable. If, on the other hand, you are in a ProTactile environment, the environment doesn’t demand of you that you engage in distantism so maybe things can take on different allures? I guess what I am getting at is that the visual hallucination (which is always on the spectrum of visual perception) is amplified under certain circumstances. We see monsters when we are scared (of the dark, say) or when we are in environments less known to us. In those cases, our hope is to unsee them (and be safe). But in a safe environment, there is a different field of affordances and perception can manage more neurodiversity. No longer working as hard to see car from sidewalk from tree (which can be a really hard thing for neurodiverse folks), the safer environment allows for fabulation of the radical kind - the feeling of a world emerging… What do you think? xx", "Hey Erin! So sorry for getting back to your wonderful thoughts here much too laterlyinged! But better bettering than bettered! Thank you for rem98nding me about amodlaity. I had forgotten about that and it’s great to have it inserted back. I need to spend more time to make sure it enters deeper into my thinking vocabulary. I suppose sensing is to sense what bodying is to body? You sort of separate it out or lets it loose. I think that one challenge in thinking more about this is that we don’t yet get to do a 'lot' corporeally. I’m sure lots is going on, but we don’t yet have language to talk about what we DO and what we do have plenty of borrowed language about we don’t yet do a lot of. So—we would learn more about it, it seems to me, in two ways: When we have more and more language about what we DO, what we feel, what our experiences are when we do the mundane things, to notice more and name more. And when we do more corporeal things, or make more claims, occupy and convert more spaces, working, and playing—for which there is a lot of language perhaps available but not a lot of experience yet. Take sports for an example. What would be PT sports? There are as yet the tiniest suggestions. Plenty of language to borrow about getting into the zone, states of training, exhilirations of competition, and so on. Earlier we did talk a bit about dorsality, and it’s a great example of naming something—like how I don’t need to feel the dumpster all over for confirmation. Theres a lot of dorsal information that gets passed backwards. Metatactility, yes! DeafBlind vision. Need to notice more and try to name, feel out more. Good question about training. Distantism is definitely responsible for dampening or even dissocation of sensation, sensing. I’m sure a lot is dormant or neglected. But what are good ways of training? To recover and reclaim? To explore? How to avoid egg-cartoning in training, when it just focuses something in isolation, instead of wholistically? I suppose a lot of playing, playing, playing is key! What do you think? John", "Hi all, Hal here. Just finding my way back up the cliff ledge, touching this SUSTO monster after a brief foray from this group. Mm and John, reading these messages makes me think of a phenomenon that Jelica, a DeafBlind woman (mutual friend of myself and John) has described. She tells this story of the time her dog brought in a dead squirrel. At the beginning she felt something, knew the dog had something novel by its behavior. Something opening there in a flurry of experience She got it out of the dog’s mouth then proceeded to explore it. Her husband telling her, “no no gross dont!” but she didn’t share his big picture GROSS reaction, instead she was grounded in the particulars of the squirrel, all the intricate felt parts that she suddenly had access to. She said this has happened more than once. Sighted people jumping to immediately registering a GROSS experience, but her lingering in the felt potentialities still unfolding, claws and nose and ears and fur (in this example). Could this be an example opposite of the metal dumpster? Where an experience is not spiraled outward into externalities, but is spiraled inward into internalities of new immanent relations? A decontextualization and recontextualization? An object (or other living thing in this case) behaving in a novel way which lets us feel beyond the curtain of the presumptive subject-object divide, but allows for participation in the making, opening us to the more than in the experience? A squirrel being squirrelly enough to crack open the nut of something more in what is experienced? Hal"]
