  You know I am not a sweeping person! More like vacuum sm00th-operators!

<p>   I was at Café Nevé today and then watched this guy browsing a website with all kinds of dried herbs, looked like all those black markets in the 'deep web' that sell all possible variants of weed, even those that are too strong and are therefore not legalized by the state. Then I looked closer and saw it was a website with all kinds of dried spinach, with really fancy names (and very expensive), coming from many parts of the world. He was also looking for the best fresh pasta that could be bought online. </p>

  For me translating is like writing a fanfiction, or an anarchival practice. Is this a fanfiction? It would be a really strange kind of fanfiction since you still didn't read the 'original' text. I kinda like this "strangeness", although I have to say the book that activated the title of this book is really good. Do you remember that fanfiction I bought in Drawn and Quarterly, I Love Dick - A fanfiction? I'm looking into it right now, resting and sitting on my table. I don't have a lot of books in Canada. Some years ago I used to think that I could never move somewhere if I couldn't carry all my books, which would be a bit problematic since I have many. Now I really don't care about that. Of course I would love to have all my books here but for obvious reasons (I won't pay a container trip for them without knowing how much time I have left here and even my books wouldn't fit in my little apartment).

  Unfortunately the only bobcat I saw was in the Montreal Biodome, a place that I think is kind of horrible, but I went there because the daughter of a friend was eager to visit it. I hope that bobcat escaped from the zoo, finding a nice place to live inside your dreams!

  I guess today my topics were kind of really boring. Funny to see how many different tonalities we gathered here until now. Yours was really exciting and fabulatory and mine just boring. But I had a boring day. I just downloaded the chapter of The Lure of The Ghost with your comments and "corrections" but I think I won’t open the file until tomorrow. I guess I don't want to contaminate it with my boredomness!
