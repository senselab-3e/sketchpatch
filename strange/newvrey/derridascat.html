  I could read some little thingies like some comments you did in the draft of <em> The Lure of The Ghost </em>. I needed to find a quote of Derrida's definition of archive, maybe this one, no?

<em> It is to burn with a passion. It is never to rest, interminably, from searching for the archive right where it slips away. It is to run after the archive, even if there's too much of it, right where something in it anarchives itself. It is to have a compulsive, repetitive, and nostalgic desire for the archive, an irrepressible desire to return to the origin, a homesickness, a nostalgia for the return to the most archaic place of absolute commencement. No desire, no passion, no drive, no compulsion, indeed no repetition compulsion, no ''mal-de'' can arise for a person who is not already, in one way or another, en mal d'archive. </em>
