  I was also thinking if I could get a PXL-2000 pixelvision camera I could attach it to an analog capture device that would forward the video to my computer; the video I could use as the source of something like skype, and then we could set-up something like a little film called <em> Conversations of a Future-Past </em> in which we'd skype and talk through time mixing the nightly -pixelated black-and-white cassette recorded image of the toy camera with the one you would give me back from your skype. Anyway, I'll intensify my search on Ebay and also the thrift-store because they're expensive and very fragile. Maybe I’ll get a malfunctioning one and see if somebody can fix it. I was reading a piece of news by Indiewire in which they say that those kind of cameras are extensively used by “artsy” filmmakers, but due to their fragility they're also killing this piece of media history. Not sure if I agree with this argument but it's funny to think about many things are dying: dying walls of my building, my dying body looking for a place to live, dying devices. I hope this mood will shift somehow. Somehow: I'm not sure if I want to deal with this kind of contingency.
