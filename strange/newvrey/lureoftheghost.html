      One of the few words I love being with are yours, as I am copyediting The Lure of the Ghost I feel them floating around me for the rest of the day. <i> The other(ness) voices finally found their way into this research-creation proposition and its other branches, but it's still important to be clear that when an 'I' appears, it doesn't refer to a unified subject but as the actual occasion of the writing itself, that carries anarchival traces of all the spectres that inhabit and world this body-mind, a conceptual persona in its multiplicity and monstrosity. Sometimes during the following pieces, the murmurs of the ghosts appear as 'I', they or (a) body. </i> Again and again, drifting away but please let there be room to actual leak without being drained. I keep on thinking how to incorporate those experiences and vocabularies into writing practices. How to write about an event? How to write with 'I' without ever meaning 'I'? ''[Celebrating] the fragility and the persistence of the minor gesture, perceiving in it more potential than in the self-directed 'I' that stands outside experience and speaks the major languages of the brands of individualism and humanism that frame neurotypicality as the center of being.'' (Manning, 2016; 7) What about fabulation? I saw that my art school has <i> I am Very Into You </i> in their library. I will go there Monday and get it. I am still doubting though if I should read it, but still I think it is good if it is here in my bedroom. Somebody, who I always thought hated my writing, asked me if she could have the text I read last week. Parts of it came out of here, so I put it as a reference, only to find out after I hit send that the autocorrect turned it into <i> I am Very Into You </i>. Maybe I should still send an email now 5 days later: 'I am so incredibly sorry, but please, you should know it is VREY. I am vrey into you. I am vrey into it. I am vrey, I am.'' Seeing the little red waves dancing underneath all its iterations. What is nice about giving presentations is that it is easier to steal words and to weave them like your dreams would, naturally and mischievously, your own and others, well they were never possessed by anyone to begin with, always a leaky sense of self, never personal, always intimate, always repeating. Language is always ambiguous as to the exact proposition which it indicates. Spoken language is merely a series of squeaks' (Whitehead, 1978: 264). A wet vocabulary, a strange turning point, a lure, a doubling of entering layers, a reading with, a reading of already felt but not yet read, a materialing-there-there spin-out-with-and-and yes.
