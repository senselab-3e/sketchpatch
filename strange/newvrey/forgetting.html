  I can't read. There's something wrong, anxiety came and brought its worst symptom: blurry view. I need to read and answer an important email and the corrections you made in <em> The Lure of the Ghost </em> but if feels for me that I can see only amorphous shadows floating into papers and screens. Coding also seem to be impossible, or editing. I wish I could write back using the same amorphous shadows, but it seems for me that anxiety is an accelerationist machine, eating the time from the doomsday clock. Its process of eating the time makes impossible to generate buffer time, I'm accelerating to confront full defragmentation. Yesterday a friend said to me in a Telegram group: ''do you remember when you accidentally put your hands in a hedgehog while we are at the university campus, like ten years ago?''. And I simply couldn't remember that, I am sure it never happened. But my friend is sure that it happened. It's strange since normally I have really good memory even for small details but apparently I've been forgetting complete scenarios at the same time I remember so many things that are so tinyâ€¦ Or maybe it wasn't me, or this version of me that touched the hedgehog. If at least it had left me some scars, those are another kind of memory or external device (that's really not external) to remember things, like the little one I have on my mouth from my german shepherd dangerous playing. Does the other creature have the same memory of my encounter with it? I just looked into Wikipedia and apparently Brazilian hedgehogs only live from two to five years, so unfortunately the creature is probably dead. I spent so much time looking into lifespans of other creatures, but how long do clothes survive after several and several sessions of laundromat washing? My oldest t-shirts, I guess, besides some that are already into an advanced state of degradation and only used for sleeping, are from 2014. Although I have to say they're not so old because my older ones were not 'usable' anymore, but yes, because they were not 'usable' in another sense. The body entered into some kind of mutation, it couldn't receive the textiles anymore it was used to. (a) body was showing some signs of allergy (redness, itchiness), I did all kinds of exams but there was nothing happening, I even had some of my clothes analysed by a laboratory, and there was no sign of contamination: nothing toxic, I could donate them later. I knew that there was nothing physically wrong, but I was too skeptical to believe that those clothes were clothes for a creature that ceased to exist in its then actual form even having the same weight, height, etc. I'm afraid if I continue in this cycle of constant displacement I will start to take out my own skin out, like the clothes that didn't fit anymore.
