I was translating <i> Always more than one </i> to Portuguese and look at this beautiful sentence by DJ Savarese I found there: “We might stop a movement. People think we're avoiding doing some work, but we're deserting our reasonable selves because we feel a fearful sound or see quiet green reassessed as approval”.
