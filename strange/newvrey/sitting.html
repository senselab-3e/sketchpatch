  Every day im so excited to write but then when the time comes to write im simply exhausted from all the forces; all the neurotypical tasks and expectations like having a clean body and clean house and being in time and responding to people and emails. The only possible way of response for me is to disappear, but since I still don’t know all the techniques of that practice the closest thing I can think of is to fall asleep. I opened The Lure of the Ghost again and it said “Welcome back!” It’s vrey yrev good to see you again, old friend. It makes me sad; this morning I slept in late and read a nice text in bed with a coffee. I had so much energy and beautiful words floating in my head, but then I had to go to the university. Now, I’m back home and just exhausted. All the words got sucked out of me. My stomach and skin have been so upset this week, first signs to sleep more and drink water to wash away all the typicality perhaps. Blurry words and images caused by your blurry view can be beautiful though, a bit like ghosts. Filenames deliberately misspelled, passed on through the internet as lures. Writing against memory and forgetting at the same time. Editing lure and jumping from page 60 to 82, because the end of the first page and the beginning of the last page looked exactly the same when I squeezed my eyes. Writing before your addition and after your addition from this afternoon at the same time. I miss flirting with you; now I can only flirt with the ghost of you here (hoping the ghost of me there also does some flirting) and with the boring digital words. Sending you one more compilation of a < and a 3 is going to make me cry. < and 3 always implies a less than 3. But it’s always so much more than that! At least the ghosts make up for that, they know a lot about such things. Still, the i love you makes me very glad to say to you, but also makes me just want to sit next to you and say nothing, maybe just cough once.

  Sitting next to each other and don't talk but still talk may be one of the things I love most. Every day I wake up excited to write and to plan things but mostly that feeling disappears when I get up from the bed. I've been putting so many alarms for the early morning version of me that everyday is a huge and difficult task to find the one that I have to deactivate. And they all look like the same: "find grants", "answer emails", "send emails", "finish the film", "write this", "write that". Blablablabla. I've been looking so long for a way to delete all those alarms, apparently that was possible in early versions of iOS, you just had to send a voice command: "Siri, delete all my alarms" and that was done. But this is not possible anymore. Maybe I'll die suffocated in a sea of alarms that never reached their desired outcomes.

<p> What do you think about when you see a green polyester textile bag from Dollarama? I went to the laundromat today and brought it as always. I always wash the bag with the clothes. But I think the bag is dying, or becoming another thing, for it's full of little holes. Funny thing that I've brought two of these bags to Denmark but when I've put them in the drier in the highest setting they both melted (I had to carry all the clothes in my hand praying that they didn't fall on the street, good thing I washed just a few pieces that day). Not saying that the Danish driers are better, and I guess Stig Helger wouldn't agree with that; just this specific laundromat. But I still didn't find forces to walk to a further laundromat with better dryers. Let's see if that happens during the winter, that is coming. I also had a coffee with a friend today. But didn't buy any books. Funny to think that you have <em> very </em> in your hands right now.
