    It took me some days to gain some forces to write here again, the Brazilian elections ate all my energy and I couldn't complete any single task for the past two days. In a certain sense, I knew that it was impossible for me to live there; not saying never, but right now the conditions are not favourable, independently of who wins in the second round. Of course I don't want the far-right candidate to win, but any result already established that a body that cannot sustain itself as the same body for more than two days (or two hours) cannot stay with all pieces together in a place that requires from you the constant positioning (in a sense of a subject that has to posit its views in a very clear and, I would say, typical way). I repeated many times that “Dougie Jones doesn't take position”. I guess another way to say what I want is: “Dougie Jones doesn't <em> perform </em> their position according to the signs expected by both the macro and micropolitical eyes”. I imagine that some people would think that both me and Dougie Jones are apolitical creatures. The issue is that their view of politics simply cannot understand that bodies are political and that bodies are what they can do; their affordances. Not in an essential way, I believe in plasticity, and I'm not also confining this kind of politics, I would say an animal politics according to what Massumi develops in his book, to the primacy of the experience. If I would, I would say that only those who suffer and experience the world not in the traditional way have a voice or can talk about it. If that was the case, this world had already failed. But people believe in hierarchies of both discursive and bodily enunciates: in moments like this, all the energy must be focused on the “universal” well-being, an universal that is a world-selecting, a world that can fit all kinds of identities but not those who live in the thresholds of where I end and you begin: what would be the “performance mark” of those creatures, without having to pass through all the anxiety that comes with the faking performance of being a typical activist? That's why, of course I would vote for the left-wing in Brazil and I aim for their victory, but this world, the typical world, already won. I guess I'll have to stay far away from there for a while, visiting my cats, but not aiming to effectively live there.

  Not sure why I didn't remember this before, but once a dated a girl who had a partner that is a neuroscientist. Basically what he was doing in his research was looking into neuronal markers for autism and other kinds of “issues”, and <em> intervene </em> on them through electrical stimulation, in order to stimulate the development of ‘empathy’ and other ‘social skills'. I'm not going to enter into the discussion if the scientific research was valid or not, you know I hate people who dismiss science. And obviously not judge those who want to change themselves, if possible (the research apparently was not funded and ended). But just to think into the world-bodies that are felt as necessary by the typical activists: ‘empathy’ is a necessity, bodies that feel it differently or not feel at all are condemned to judgement in the parliament of Facebook. (Empathy obviously directed to another <em> human </em> subject or <em> very well defined </em> group).

  Speaking of judgement and condemnations, yesterday during the counting of the votes of the Brazilian elections, I was watching the new Lars von Trier film: <em> The House That Jack Built </em>. Not sure if I liked the film but it has a lot of anarchival qualities. And the epilogue is incredible: the path to hell is through crypts, full of water, a hole opened into the ground, you walk through underworld crypts and voila: you're in hell. You remember that in <em> Riget </em> it's the water leaking into the ground from the previous world of the bleachers that guides the transport of entities from one universe to another. I think both films/series happen in the same universe and there's a network of tunnels where water runs that can guide us to other worlds of the multiverse. We need more crypts. A cryptoverse, maybe (I’m not talking about cryptography or cryptocurrencies but actual crypts) - we have to find the right materials! -, like the Underspazz for example, but more rhizomatic. A world under our world (that's not really ours). If hell and the bleachers’ world, or laundroworld(?) is leaking into this world, I'm already feeling it.
