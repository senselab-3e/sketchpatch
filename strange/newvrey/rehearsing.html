    Everything we write as a question, that is open, that marks multiplicity, goes beyond the individual and is to be endlessly unpacked and explored. Techniques of reusing, rehearsing, reviving, revisiting, reviewing, and reciting. To think that we are not writing when we wrote it. In Very all of it is emails, which makes it a conversation, a correspondence, but in <em> Vrey </em> everything is in the live word file, making it at the same time and at the same place, making it into a meeting rather than a dialogue. <em> Vrey </em> is perhaps written because we are neglecting everything what we were supposed to write instead; emails, tweets, to-do-lists, names for alarm reminders, linkedin profile, grant applications, answers to the same questions. No <em> Vrey </em> is written because it is not a neglecting, it is a caring for everything we are writing here. I always like words but then when I attend a whole evening of people reciting lines at some point I’m just sick and sick of it. One person told the audience that they were wearing a wig and then suddenly all the other people seemed to be wearing one as well. Lovers of bad timing. I wanted to go and leave all the words, maybe there were just too many words at some point, I saw I had accidentally drawn a spaceship, or some kind of aircraft, in my notebook. “What about all the things that go unsaid?” That’s such a boring question, that’s the anarchive, it’s all about the things that go unsaid. Maybe that’s why when too many words are said it makes me want to leave. Everything we write as a question, but not a verbal one, let me circle around you, take care of you, float away and listen to the things we never said. Makes me want to wrap you in, or it, not to hold away from what is around you, but to circle around until it’s happening again; to start unpacking. But not unwrapping until there’s nothing left, no, maybe circling in the opposite direction to see all that got caught in the circles between. Or threading back and seeing all the dust that got caught onto the needle’s track. Not unwrapping as in unraveling an essence, oh no, let’s forever forget about that. Unthreading as in starting the same question with different words. Or better; as in starting the same question with a different temporality of letters: <em> Vrey </em>? Maybe it was always the same question as Very had, but with a different temporality of letters, and thereby with a different temporality of meeting. Like Dougie, and Cooper, and Other Dougie, and Mr. C, and whoever more than that; a different writing, in the same document. Forever writing, circling, leaking, meeting, becoming, dancing, assembling letters - I wake up to your words that you have been writing while I was doing the same in my sleep.
