Invisibility not as an absence but as a point in which it cannot be seen through the bare eyes of neurotypicality (and when invisible creatures can be seen?). Invisibility is a productive device. A neurodiverse body, as all minor bodies, the black body, the migrant body, the native body, is always non-existent: it is not seen, parsed out of experience. It can still be felt, but for this the full feeling of feltverses need to be affirmed in the appetites.appetitive adventure is necessary, and 'passage precedes position'. <i>''On peut bien décrire les existantes comme 'jetés' dans le monde, invoquer leur ''être-au-monde''. Mais comment font ceux qui ne trouvent pas l’entrée qui les fait ''être-au-monde''Ils ne s'éprouvent pas commes jetés dans le monde, mais plutôt rejetés au-dehors, expulsés par sa réalité même.

  <div class="box" data-content="I feel very spread out now that you are in Copenhagen. I couldn’t sleep for the past two nights, I woke up so early, which is vrey unlike me. I think it is because I’m still synched to your sleep and I sensed that you already woke up being ahead 6 hours. There are infinites of you and some are here with me and some of mine are there with you. That’s what makes me feel so spread out and accompanied by future spectres. Makes me think of that I sensed like a spectre of you was with me before I met you. Often meeting is more recognizing than meeting, don’t you think? Something is here again. We feel a lot the same. Actually that was the feeling I had when I met you. Not a meeting, but a recognising, and therein I found a calmness. I felt relieved, because I knew as soon as I met you I didn’t have to explain myself or clarify my presence. I knew that there was a mutuality, an understanding, which made me calm and reassured that bodies can be at places or in company without having to actively relate in the exhaustive sense -which is often in neurotypical settings a verbal mode. The relation was already established in the recognition rather than an explanation.

Everything about it is no. No to inside, no to absence, no to witness, no to empathy, no to the text, no to the quote, no to Peter Levine who wrote this, no the font. I like our font better, it’s called spectral. I’m glad that our texts are soaked in specturality, says more about ghosts from the past than any part of that quote, don’t you think?

  <div class="box" data-html="true" data-content="It took me some days to gain some forces to write here again, the Brazilian elections ate all my energy and I couldn't complete any single task for the past two days. In a certain sense, I knew that it was impossible for me to live there; not saying never, but right now the conditions are not favourable, independently of who wins in the second round. Of course I don't want the far-right candidate to win, but any result already established that a body that cannot sustain itself as the same body for more than two days (or two hours) cannot stay with all pieces together in a place that requires from you the constant positioning (in a sense of a subject that has to posit its views in a very clear and, I would say, typical way). I repeated many times that “Dougie Jones doesn't take position”. I guess another way to say what I want is: “Dougie Jones doesn't perform their position according to the signs expected by both the macro and micropolitical eyes”. I imagine that some people would think that both me and Dougie Jones are apolitical creatures. The issue is that their view of politics simply cannot understand that bodies are political and that bodies are what they can do; their affordances. Not in an essential way, I believe in plasticity, and I'm not also confining this kind of politics, I would say an animal politics according to what Massumi develops on his book, to the primacy of the experience. If I would, I would say that only those who suffer and experience the world not in the traditional way have voice or can talk about it. If that was the case, this world had already failed. But people believe in hierarchies of both discursive and bodily enunciates: in moments like this, all the energy must be focused on the “universal” well-being, an universal that is a world-selecting, a world that can fit all kinds of identities but not those who live in the thresholds of where I end and you begin: what would be the “performance mark” of those creatures, without having to pass through all the anxiety that comes with the faking performance of being a typical activist? That's why, of course I would vote for the left-wing in Brazil and I aim for their victory, but this world, the typical world, already won. I guess I'll have to stay far away from there for a while, visiting my cats, but not aiming to effectively live there." ><img align="center" width="185" src="img/image35.jpg"></div>

  <div class="box" data-content="I think I would prefer the octopodal mode of thinking through different tentacles that have their own desires, the lures that activate them... But I don't really think that cats cannot do that, or humans - or more-than humans (specially). The event knows itself to the order of what the event wants, and I think a good and non-translatable encounter like ours happens when the creatures that compose the event-eventing are involved in some tendencies that can have different modulations but still can in a way interact and input contagiousness generating a kind of movement that is a bit not-coordinated but that carries a strange beauty. I talk about all the versions of me that exceed my body talking to all the versions of you (well, maybe not all of them, I'm sure some versions of me may not like that, but they are infinite...or at least I think they tend to infinity.) And they have this thing that is like a council, but not through consent or something like that, or not the council of Ricks from Rick and Morty, that I kind of like but seems to be held upon very linguistic agreements of what needs to be done. Well, I see more like an orgy than a council, not paying respect to those really boring people that describe themselves as “super dionisiac” but are still attached to the whole body/mind divide… If they ever read Descartes… But there also some people that don't read Descartes and still contest him. Oh, I hate people, I really prefer the ghosts of me that “talk” to the ghosts of you, the ghosts of the future's past, or the past's future, something that has to do in a way with what Whitehead calls the “negative prehension” of an occasion or event that people who are too typical cannot really understand, but well, they have already all our jobs, I hope at least they give us the pleasure of understanding a *really* tinyyyyy part of Whitehead's ontological system.

  <div class="box" data-content="I love frictionous, or frictioness, or fricticious. Frictional, fictinal, fabulational. Fabulation is vrey frictionous, don’t you think? The versions of me and you writing, and capturing. It is a good thing that we have the same camera. It makes so much sense. I feel like your film roll was in mine, and I developed your captures, or we developed my capturing fabulation, or you captured our frictionous development, etc., etc. I want to wonder more about frictionous relating to fabulation relating to capturing. I’ll leave some space here to come back to that soon. Or you know what, I think we are already coming back to that by writing this. Also, did you see I included the picture of the spread-out tea, slowly falling out of the tiny hole in the bottom of the cup? What I like about that image is that it only works on a certain scale. If it’s small enough, it blends, everything backgrounding, but then when it is just a bit bigger, it expands, everything foregrounding by being blurry it never will. Which is beautiful, it cannot foreground because there was no specific capturing. I certainly do not think that enlarging relates to foregrounding, or that by enlarging something gets foregrounded, but for this instance I think yes, that’s the case. Or better, it tries to do so, but can keep on doing so because it will never fuelly come there. Imagine, the picture expanding and expanding, falling of my laptop screen, falling of yours, onto the picnic table, along the street onto the river bank, greetings the swans, into the water.
"><br> Could you live in a place with zero pieces of furniture? </div>
  <div class="box" data-html="true" data-content="I would love to be in friction with those swans and ducks, maybe feed them, not sure if I would like to feed them because they're already too much fed by the humans that think that they exist to serve their desires of cuteness, but I was afraid to interact with them because the parents of that child would find strange a 30 year old person interacting with her young daughter. It was funny, though, because there was a constant tension, I felt they were going to bite the girl really soon. On that sense, I liked that the parents let her feed them and go and be bitten, at least she experiences another less cute-human oriented version of animal politics than the usual servitude they expect from creatures that are not considered ontologically equal but as servants of guilty photographing. And I think the image of the almost leaky tea has this uncanny tonality not only, but also because of the camera used to take it… It's so funny that we have the same camera, but as you, I’m a bit tired of having it. It always fails in something, well, I like failure, but I think my Snappy is going to reach absolute failure really soon, I hope after I end this expensive trip to Denmark when I'll be able to finally buy a better analogue camera from eBay or find one in the group of traders. Also the almost-leakage of the tea reminds me of the leakage that caused your keyboard to act strangely, as the pores of your body, no? It seems that all machines are contaminated by this feeling of failure sometimes, and there's nothing we can do besides waiting. Them to disappear, break, or new machines to appear (what usually involves a lot of money…). At least your pores are working again no? Every time I end a paragraph I feel that I didn't answer anything that was commented before, but yes, maybe I have serious problems with linearity. Eventually those answers that are not answers but new questions will appear, or will have appeared in a future that is also a past. Is it future or is it past?
"> <img align ="left" width ="185" src=img/image15.jpg></img></div>
  <div class="box" data-html="true" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Spectres of the future are always visiting me. I wake up and they are already there. Sometimes I wonder if that virtuality of the future that decomposes me will really actualize or if there's no future at all without the right conditions… Well, I know time linearity is not a thing, what makes me live the future that will not happen in the future right now, and it's a kind of painful future. I wonder if with accumulation other movements appear. Movements that are not necessarily of accumulation but of dispersion. Like dispersion of the particles of textile every time I go to the laundromat, something gets lost, tiny particles of textile disappear by using, reusing, watching and drying everything many and many times. I know also some things are attached to them by contagiousness and cross-pollination of adventures in the laundromat, or the salt from the sea that penetrates my pores and my swimming clothes. But most things get thinner, like the sole of my boots, I really like the sensation of touching them and seeing that they're becoming smoother. You may have noticed that I do that oftenly. Repetition, or obsession, as some psychiatrists have said to me. I remember one of them talking to me that if I didn’t resolve the questions of repetitive behaviour I would never get a job. Guess what, I'll never resolve these questions because they're not really questions but just false problems (except that I may never get a job, which will bring more spectres from the future and things like that, but well, let's see). I really love new obsessions, saying the same words again and again and again. Of course each time it's in a different way but most of the people are not able to see that. You know I really hate boring things and boring people but maybe repetition is something that bothers those boring people or at least this kind of repetition that is less repetitive or in a less boring way for them to put everything into the neurotypical topology back again and smile like everything is okay and working… I couldn't continue to watch the Alain Resnais’ film after that. Well, I watched, but really bored. That's basic sci-fi rules that were not obeyed, not that I'm a purist or something like that, it's just that it doesn't make any sense, even if it was supposed to be a nonsense, it failed on that. It was more like a spiritualist film for me, in which the soul had to travel and see again and again what it did in a purgatorial way without having any agency - not that I believe in free will, but I believe in an infinitude of possible worlds.

good thing v-r-e-y has 4 different letters, because otherwise there would be less combinations ! if vrey had five letters it would be 5x4x3x2x1
nice no?
if we made a word out of the whole alphabet it would be 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8x9x10x11x12x13x14x15x16x17x18x19x20x21x22x23x24
but if we could reuse letters it would be 4^4

  <div class="box" data-content="Yes, I feel the same; a variation of the same - it's a nice feeling when I meet somebody and I don't need to jump into answering typical and functional questions like: ''what do you do?'', ''why are you living here?'', or even ''what are your plans?''. That one is the worst for me. It's so pleasant when I find somebody that I already know, or at least I know that I don't need to put things into words with my mouth because communication is already happening on other levels and strata. Language hurts a lot and flirting with language is a feeling that I don't know if I can still do. Since those things are said in different ways, and traditional objective consent is very typical and already a big restraint for the future of a relation (between bodies or anything). Really anything, like when people enter the room full of thingies and just put the chair back where it ''should be''. Does the chair want to be there again doing its repetitive ''task'' and helping those really boring asses that need to work? Not sure if I am anthropomorphizing things too much but at least it's the way I get to understand what is wanted (or what can be lured without having to express a single word).

“It's vrey vrey nice to see you again, my old friend”

Did you see me typing?
Should images be added?

Yes I think it’s very important to have images be part of this.

Why very? Or not vrey?
You don't like vrey anymore?

Oh, out of habit. But apart from that I think just because vrey exists (and you know how much I love it), doesn’t mean very can’t be used anymore. Very is a different mode than vrey.

Also, it’s so nice to not know where something is taking, or should take. There are not a lot of places where a content does not have to be speculated before starting. Starting should start the middle.
Oh yes, that's true, and I just realized a strange thing, I couldn’t find references to Mister C saying vrey, then i put the scene description on google search and found a lot of reddit posts talking about it, but as YREV, so maybe VREY was invented, or manufactured, out of novelty, maybe he never said vrey but only yrev, that's very how it's pronounced on the red room language reversal arrangement.
Ohh ! That’s such a nice realisation. I was already thinking “how did the r jus jump like that”. But now that I know about YREV… ! Makes me want to record you saying very (if I ever catch you though… you very often say vrey lately) and try to play it in every different way...  very, vrey, yrev, yrev. 4 letters makes (4!), 4x3x2x1 combinations possible, no?

I love reversal speaking for recordings, to say vrey i would have to say yerv and then revert it with the audio editing tool. Yerv is a nice word no? We can record it on the bathtub, no?

Oh yes I love reversal speaking bathtub recordings. I’ll add some bathtub pictures too. I’m pretty sure we share a love for bathtubs.

  <div class="box" data-content="Not sure why I didn't remember this before, but once a dated a girl who had a partner that is a neuroscientist. Basically what he was doing in his research was looking into neuronal markers for autism and other kinds of “issues”, and intervene on them through electrical stimulation, in order to stimulate the development of ‘empathy’ and other ‘social skills'. I'm not going to enter into the discussion if the scientific research was valid or not, you know I hate people who dismiss science. And obviously not judge those who want to change themselves, if possible (the research apparently was not funded and ended). But just to think into the world-bodies that are felt as necessary by the typical activists: ‘empathy’ is a necessity, bodies that feel it differently or not feel at all are condemned to judgement in the parliament of Facebook. (Empathy obviously directed to another human subject or very well defined group).

<div class="box" data-content="I have been missing you too much. I find living vrey difficult but it was so much lighter doing it in your company, being-with you. The world is blue and there’s nothing we can do. Well there’s things we can do. We were talking about humans (not hvmans) only caring when things affect themselves. And that’s why it is necessary for us to keep writing and making and loving. It has been so nice to be in the same timezone as you, waking up together, going to bed together. September always brings a lot of spectres from the future for me. Spectrember? To flip back to the soles of your shoes.. I have noticed you touch them a lot. They’re very smooth! Smooth like the arch of your feet. I had never felt such soft arches like yours before! It’s intriguing cause again and again and again you move with your fingers on your toes in painful ways cause you find it difficult to walk through life. A speculative finding of feet? It was necessary to learn to walk again, colorful band-aids in every corner of the feet. I always get so stressed when I am buying new shoes. Because I never know what size feels good, often each size does not feel good. And then there’s somebody working in the shoe store asking: “And how does it feel?” Which just makes me want to scream: “I don’t know how it feels!!! I can’t feel my feet!!!!” A person once told me I should buy heavier shoes to make sure I keep my feet on the ground. Strange how shoes are represented in neurotypical structures. The shoes I wore a lot in Montréal have really coarse soles, which makes it possible for them to mischievously maneuver and take along things from place to place. Entering the elevator of the university, feeling that one of my legs was longer than the other, looking underneath my foot, finding a big pebble from the other dimension I was just in. Sometimes I took it out the grooves and put it on the floor of the elevator, sometimes I kept it there; keeping my one leg slightly longer than the other, somehow anticipating that that would come in handy later in the day. Leaving the big stone all alone on the floor reminds me of the one time that I was small and I was at the dentist and coughed, something small came up and I spit it on the floor. He got so mad and asked: “Why did you do that?! Would you’ve done that at your own home?!!” And I thought: “Yes I would”. I didn’t even understand what he meant with the distinction between my own home and other places when talking about coughing. I didn’t understand what I did wrong but he made sure I still felt ashamed. As if certain things shouldn’t cross certain thresholds, as if I should have been disgusted by things coming out of my body. I think we could link this to the relation to shoes. Somehow things from ‘outside’, or maybe better ‘some other side/site’ are not allowed to be left like that, taken along like that, maneuvered-with. Probably if I would have been in the elevator with someone from the university they would have asked: “Why did you do that?” or at least look at me in a certain way. It is because I like travelling things, either from the depths of my throat, or from the assemblage of big pebbles, I would have answered.

I also went there to have a coffee with an old lover, but as soon as I smelled his familiar smell I understood I didn’t love him anymore. It was a bit painful because in the way he encountered me I could tell how much he cared about me. He said as I was looking out of the window that my eyes always look as if I’m drowning in my thoughts. I said, oh yes, I drown all the time, to which he said I imagine your head as if it’s Atlantis. He asked a couple of weeks ago already if he could sleep at my place and I told him no. Two minutes after he posted a iPhone drawing of a vulva on his Instagram. I proposed to have this coffee. He said he had seen that one of my closest friends had been up to; weaving the sounds of birds in a little tower. I felt a bit pretentious, getting the Very book and another one from Deleuze. The person from the library was nice though, he let me take them even though I didn’t have a student number and they misspelled my last name. Reading the preface before I got onto my bike made me sad. They talk about a seduction, not about a love. It made me think whether this is for you also a temporary seduction instead of creating conditions, sharing sensitivities and having love for all variations of each other. I had to think about my dream again in which you told me you never wanted to see me again to which my pores replied by clogging until I died. I stopped halfway on the bike because I wanted to write all of this down, but somewhere where they were doing the piping so it smelled like poop and I moved to further down the street where the park begins with the little tower and the loom and the birds.

<div class="box" data-content="Shoes can be really good sm00th-operators, I am not sure if I will buy new shoes any moment soon because the soles of mine feel vrey sm00th. I really like to put my hands there specially when they travelled over carpets and things like that which apparently make them every smoothier. Although I went to the beach yesterday and my shoes are still full of sand and they seem a little bit less smooth. The sea though is also a sm00th-operators for our bodies, especially cold water. Delicious. It's always those typical questions: ''ohh, but what is you project, what is your research, what are you doing?''. Somebody that seemed really interesting said that they really liked my presentation and then asked me if we could exchange some things because we're working on similar things. “Ohh, nice, I thought”. Then I said that I would send her the project I'm working on and it would be nice if she could send me something of her. “Ohh yes, bla bla bla, I want to read yours but only after October because I'm sending a lot of postdoc applications, etc.”. Not that I disliked this person but my body couldn't understand how that person separates time that well. I really don’t understand, because when I'm working on an application or something like that I think that everything I'm doing is part of that (everything I’m watching, everywhere I'm walking, every picture I take). Not in the sense that I’m going to insert those things in a paper or art piece or something like that, but simply because I cannot separate what I feel during those experiences from what I’m writing or doing. Well, not only when I’m writing an application or something alike. I feel that everything belongs to a certain world-building, that sometimes can converge to a multiverse-building due to all the inhabitants that haunt this what people like to call a body. I don't really understand this process of ontologization that says that the format of an application and its “selected bibliography” is more important than reading what other people do, or look at how the cats are chasing birds on the street. But people tend to do that, especially with time, departmentalized time, I guess that's one of the reasons why they get the jobs in this really boring world. At the same time I’m really excited, it seems to me that Aarhus is a place with a lot of potentials for ghosts of the future and the past, or to be anarchivized, something that I believe is already being done. People would say that this kind of feet soles belong to individuals who never worked much in their lives, but I'm not sure about that. And yes, writing and loving and making is necessary to keep alive this continuum where nobody knows where one begins and the other ends.

<div class="box" data-content="There is no inside or outside, but rather modes of insiding or outsiding. I want modes for making and writing that directly relate to and consist out of sharing, caring, glancing, being together, fluidity and fragility. Mirrors, ice, and glass are surfaces that can be related to writing surfaces. One numbs experiences or encounters when one does not know what to do with them yet; they freeze, to be defrosted when new compositions of words arrive. Transmission and reflection do not only become immediate forms, but also attitudes. Sharing, with oneself, with others, with creatures, or with thingies. What is between them, as the flows between them, as a wet approach to assembling, editing, and gathering. You’re boarding right now, I feel so strange.

<div class="box" data-content="Something is happening again. I was told that when you go into an MRI scan, you go into such a big magnetic force that your balance organ is affected by it. While you’re sliding into the machine, it feels like you’re turning to the right, but ‘actually’ you’re just sliding straight into it. ''Actually?'' I said. ''Yeah you’re confused of what actually happened.'' But then I thought; if you feel you turned right, then it still also ‘actually happened’. I really don’t understand when there’s a difference made between those things! It happened, again, and at the same, always, and again again. For me everything I think, dream, feel, remember is just as part of what happened. And honestly, often I can’t even discern between those things. And honestly, it’s often a bigger part of what happened than what ‘actually happened’. That’s why I really don’t trust someone when they can just get out of bed and wake up like hop hop hop. No, I need to transition! So much happened. So much happened again. I went to a talk of Laurie Anderson, while she was talking and showing and making I wrote down some words in the dark. Reality not as something to recognize anymore. What are nights for? To fall through time into another world? Still living in a world of stories, soon you’re not telling the stories; we’re drowning in our own stories. And then something I can’t read. Gravity’s random, but could also be gravity’s raindown. When he appears late in the story it is only because he simply wasn’t written yet. All the things I lost in the flood. For everything you don’t know; true or false.

For me it has to do a lot with care techniques, but not care related to the identitarian or unitarian people but to the events that specially include other creaturesque ecologies of non-human or more-than human. But it's impossible to write or read anything right now because they're cutting onions in the kitchen of the cafe. I really don't like this sensation, it seems to me there's a lack of care, everybody  are rubbing their hands in their eyes. Maybe I’ll have to come back to this document later. What do you think about onions? Do you remember when we used to come to this cafe and this sensation contaminated everything?
But this café also brings me memories of the Danish dog around your house nearby. I just developed a roll of film and look who I found:

<div class="box" data-content="Both our bodies are expelling themselves. Anarchival practices of not being able to be somewhere or sometime. We’re very symbiotic creatures, dancing and appearing and disappearing. I’m so nervous for tomorrow morning, I know you’ll be here, but still you’ll be sleeping so I think I’ll feel like going in circles again and again and again. Waiting all those long few minutes for an extra stripe to appear or never appear. I heard that after the appearing happened for four minutes you shouldn’t look at the stripes anymore, because then a second stripe could appear without meaning it wanted to appear. It can just come without having to mean anything. The first stripe could even disappear without that meaning anything. It’s so scary to feel so much distance to my organs. Everybody’s asking what I’m feeling, but I’m not feeling anything anymore. The only thing I remember was my instancious feeling and I think I should keep remembering that in order to stay calm. It’s not that I don’t want a ghost travelling inside me; something that escaped the event of us meeting and travelled across the ocean, but it just doesn’t seem like it did. It would have been easier if it wasn’t across the ocean and maybe a year later. It is very strange, this possibility of not choosing to have something living with you, and having to remember and re-remember all the moments, repeating them in our minds; did something happen that we missed? Did something slip our memory? It would be beautiful, it would be very persistent; like most of our ghosts are. And it is so strange, something going on ‘inside’, while I don’t even think I believe  in an inside like that. But still, having no idea of what is going on inside there. We can only guess. Often our guessing is affected by anxiety. Those two stripes, I’m sure I want to check them and see them again and again, flipping my eyes between the clock and the stripes. I can only look at them for four minutes, then they won’t ‘mean’ anything anymore. What if the stripes turn into the arms of the clocks? I’ll see the two arms making circles, my arms trying to capture the stripe so I can show you and myself, the stripe appearing as one but maybe soon as double.

<div class="box" data-content="I was expecting some anarchival qualities to come with the rolls of film that I brought from Denmark, I've read that the X-ray machines can produce undesirable effects on the pictures. That's everything I ever wanted; to have some ghosts in my images. However, I developed the first film and there was nothing. Only reinforcing my idea that it's hard for those ghosts to appear when there's a very specific and determinate desire of the aesthetical form they should present themselves in (like when I used to expect to finally be abducted by aliens during my sleep when I was a child). Well, also I've read that that affects only film with sensitivities higher than 800 ISO and the X-ray in the checked luggage is way stronger, which made my will almost impossible with the Snappy camera that accepts only 400 ISO and the low cost flight of WOW // spoiler: I bought a new camera on eBay and it's really weird but still didn't arrive // Maybe I should put them inside an MRI machine, which also is one of the first scenes of Riget (I'm loving to watch this tv-show again). But also I figured that the ghosts are there in another forms that were not detectable by our figurative way of looking into pictures. We should attend more to the minimal beings that are hardly visible only with the sense of sight. Maybe we need more haptic ghosts. Should I answer you in a more direct manner? I feel that I never respond to what you say, at least in a typical way… I'm super happy about the stripes!! But also super sad about the body in stress/unrestness. I guess it's a kind of media apparatus we could work more with, appearing and disappearing letters, like when you did the wet reading (but also like those pens children use to cheat on exams, that can write and be erased really easily…).

<div class="box" data-content="It is as big as a grain of sand, but is as heavy as a stone you’d normally carry with two hands. It’s laying in the palm of my hand. It would’ve fit on my fingertip but my finger simply bends too heavily when I tried to hold it there. Carrying in my closed hand works, and then just opening it when I show it to every body around me. I’m so fond of it, I can’t help myself but show it. I have to bend my arm a bit, you can see my muscles flexing when I lower my hand and open the fingers. First I did some research. I was just naively googling things as “heaviest particle” and I finally found the right material, it wasn’t that hard. There are so many schemes and indexes, a lot of humans sadly enough have always been obsessed with structuring. Luckily I had a lover working in chemical engineering. He used to work on reactor membranes, which was tricky because the membrane had to vacuolize the right amount of oxygen but at the same time make sure to not give a particular reaction, like oxygenation. I drove to where he lives here in the Netherlands, really close to the sea and when I got back home I put it on a stack of fabrics. It’s so beautiful to see such a small grain making such an impact, drawing the fabrics to the wooden floor. What’s nice about giving presentations is that it’s easier to steal words and weave them like your dreams would, naturally and mischievously, your own and others, well they were never anyone’s to begin with, always a leaky sense of words. I just took some words from you and me and other readings I love. It’s nice to speak out both what you and I have written. Speaking our dialogue out load, which was never a dialogue to begin with. But to switch from my dusty pores to “a 30 year old talking to a little girl” is extraordinarily beautiful.

<div class="box" data-content="I've been thinking a lot about the bike you gave me. She’s beautiful, no? Also it is not something I didn't know before, but you love me a lot to have been going for months with me by foot to eat nearby, because I discovered I can go to those places in like, 3 minutes, by bike. But also some confuse feelings are affecting my body, like: it’s already mid-September, which means, well, in December there's snow and no biking anymore (at least for me), and then snow, and snow, and snow again, and it's almost time to move again from Canada if nothing happens. Moving to nowhere because there's at least at this moment no future or past but just ghosts of a future that sound really scared. Maybe that's the reason I don't like to stay at home, and that it took me a while to have a bike. Those things are like some kind of root-producing devices (you know I don't believe in the ideas of rooting and etc), but this displacement is so cruel that I don't risk myself to love a house because I know I will suffer when I miss it. Reminds me of some girl that came to talk to me two years ago or so at a party, they were releasing some Deleuzian books. “Well, you know, I'm here now, but I'm moving, always moving, I am a nomad. Bla bla bla”. I felt myself melting at that time, first because it's so easy for neurotypicals to play themselves as “alternative cultures” deleuzian thinkers/artists, when they really never understood anything, being nomadic doesn't mean necessarily physically always moving, or at least not in the traditional sense of travelling, but also going to other existential territories. The movement of the nomad is not extensive but intensive. I think right now in order for me to move I have to be somewhere for a while, for some years. To move with the ghosts that inhabit and flood this body this body needs to be in a place, which I don't see much hope for right now, what makes me stuck and non-nomadic, if that's the right thing to say. Well, there's no right thing to say, but I would love to move with the bike being able to move my ghosts, what is difficult in this situation of displacement. “It's happening again”. Poor Dougie, I remember how much he travelled.

<div class="box" data-content="My grandmother had a lot of neurodiverse tendencies. I think she would’ve enjoyed a place where they were better understood. Or it is not about understanding, and it’s also not about having a place, because my grandfather was always very loving and created conditions, maybe even too much so (in a way that it hurt him), but maybe understanding for herself in a way that is not even verbal. I think she had a lot of tendencies but felt stressed because she felt like she wasn’t supposed to have them. She always took off all her clothes as soon as she came home, but nobody was supposed to know about that. She hardly ever wanted to have visitors coming to her house, but she never knew how to express that. My father only found out a few years ago that one of the reasons was because she always covered all the furniture in sheets and bed covers. It was simply impossible for somebody to visit spontaneously because then she had to take down all those sheets. Ever since I heard about those sheets I haven’t been able to stop thinking about them. Covering up all the cabinets, white fabrics to hide from the world, just as how ghosts have always been represented in pop culture.

<div class="box" data-content="Funny logo printed on the faux-leather that covers the lens of my new camera (and make it look like a small wallet). I looked into Wikipedia on “PaineWebber” and apparently it “was an American stock brokerage and asset management firm that was acquired by the Swiss bank UBS AG in 2000. The company was founded in 1880 in Boston, Massachusetts, by William Alfred Paine and Wallace G. Webber”. Since this camera model was released in 1994 it may have been used by an employee of that financial company in its last days of decadence. What was it used for? I'm not sure, but it's very special because it allowed people to be very sneaky since it really doesn't look like a camera when it's closed, and although being so small, it still carries almost the same quality as the now a cult-following object Olympus Mju 2. I wouldn't say it could be used for espionage because at that time they already had a lot of better technical devices for that. I have to say it's not invisible but it's so visible as other thing, that it could be used for that. “The owls are not what they seem”, like this leather object is not what it seems. I'm writing this while I'm sitting in a sofa in the Spaze, with my boots on. That can’t be a good sign, I'm so sad that it feels that it doesn't matter for my body to be less or more comfortable, since the most probable outcome of future ghosts of displacement is the death, or the complete deterritorialization of the body. Normally I like to put my bare feet on the ground, even with all my fingers cut because of anxiety and sadness. I wish I could find a way far from self-mutilation but also I think lethargy could rise to such a high level that even for that I won’t have the energy. Speaking of, I was so attracted by the Rick and Morty pair of socks in Urban Outfiters, but at the same time felt strange buying something with such clear human faces. Then we had that conversation stating that they're not necessarily human but more-than human, in the sense that there are infinite universes of Ricks and Mortys so in most of those universes they could have non-human traits, even looking like human, or even in the human-like creatures there's more-than human. So I started to feel a bit happy again, resonating with this moment right now I feel a bit of happiness in the midst of all this future displacement ghost that populates the instances of this body with sadness. I guess I will take off my boots a little bit to let my feet breathe.

<div class="box" data-content="Also, it just came into my mind: you still haven't bought the I'm very into You book/exchange of emails by McKenzie Wark and Kathy Acker. That's so funny, but that’s also why this looks so anarchival :) Only qualities and tendencies.
It’s good you keep on writing even when I don’t. I keep telling myself I’m too sad to write and I have so much to tell you that I have to find the right moment. But the things is; I never find the right moment to write and only keep getting sadder. I’m glad you keep the pace, and remind me that we should just keep pacing and trust that anarchival tendencies will bring us back to the writings, so we can write what we wanted to write even when we will never know what we wanted to write. Your pace creates conditions. And that is exactly what we were talking about; a living-with. It is not about codependency (have you also noticed that this has suddenly become fashionable, like me talking with my roommate, noticing she was on the phone “Oh sorry I didn’t know you were calling someone” “Oh no, that’s just my boyfriend, we FaceTime when we’re not together, haha we’re so needy”, and me standing there with my eyes full of despair and my mouth full of disgust), but about survival. It is not about needing each other, it is about making it able to live, about creating conditions. I moved all my stuff back into my apartment. I promised myself this is the last time I move to this city, one year and one year only, my body can’t live here anymore. The more I try to understand why this city makes me so sad, the less I understand. There’s is something wrong about me being here. Probably it has something to do with ghosts. My mother always tells me I’m so sad because I have other people’s ghosts visiting me too, haha. Well, she would never use the world ghost like that, but that’s what she says; “You’re sad about things that are not even your own sadness”. When I was in Montréal I had ghosts visiting me too, but those I could place much easier. Well not always, you remember that day when I just couldn’t stop crying and I didn’t know why? I think that is perfectly fine and even beautiful, but here I don’t feel just sad, I feel stressed and restless and weird.

I love the first picture of the roll where there’s always missing something (but also adding something). This is the room they rented for me when I was in Aarhus. The kid that lives there is called Alice, well, I think so… her name was on the door, some Lego-like letters attached to the it, forming the name A-L-I-C-E, but then I accidentally broke the letter I. Now it's just A-L-C-E. It would be nice if they adopted this new name for her. It's “reindeer” in Portuguese!

<div class="box" data-content="Yesterday I was sitting in between all my boxes filled with stuff and just had to cry. Suddenly it hit me I’ll be in Amsterdam again for a whole year. You tell me you write here because you feel like you have to, but that I shouldn’t feel pressured to do the same. I told the wandering albatross to come see the words moving here again. Yesterday I was so restless and started unpacking, hoping that by moving with the things I would feel a bit of joy. I saw so many thingy-friends I almost had forgotten about. Actually, the only things I was really excited about seeing again were my plants, but they all looked so sad. Brown leaves, dried out, hanging down. The person that was in my room for the time I was in Montréal didn’t take care of them at all. It is because people consider themselves more important, and always just think about themselves in relation to other persons. The only thing he left me was a bottle of wine and a little booklet laying on my nightstand. I opened the booklet, being a curious creature, but also because I didn’t trust him leaving something behind like that. I know him and I knew he would’ve taken everything he cared about. The booklet was completely empty, except that the first page was ripped out and the second page said “Anouk is beautiful x [his name]”. I wish he would’ve expressed his love for me by taking care of my plants like I asked if he wanted to. I saw my brother today and he told me I should just rip out that page as well and use it for my own words. I’m not sure about that, I don’t think any glad words will ever appear there. I have so many booklets with sad ghosts running around the first pages already. I moved around with all my stuff, tried so many techniques the spaz taught me, but my thingies still didn’t look happy. I hope soon they will again. I need at least one place in this city that will give me some rest. I was only happy yesterday when I found some stones I had gathered from Denmark and Canada in a paper bag. There’s something about stones and paper bags. Paper bags around stones, stones on paper bags, paper bags between stones, stones around paper bags. They like to be wrapped. Somehow I link that to the sensitive dishwashers of Riget. Those fabulatory speakers in the cellar know so much more than all the other persons running around on the ground floor and above. They talk about the events presenting themselves again, the building starting to cry, something hiding in the silence, things that come and can’t be washed away with water. One technique that is really important for me and I know it is for you too, is taking a shower after a long day with a lot of typicality. Or taking all my clothes of after being in a train with too many sad people around. It is a way to anarchive the draining events. "> <br> Oh my god, we almost reached 80 pages of message exchanging!!

<div class="box" data-content="I’m getting sadder everyday. There’s something in this city, something like it doesn’t permit a body to be unstable. I’m having a hard time trying to put in words how I’ve been feeling. Something like: always a leaky sense of self, but because a body can’t be unstable, the leakyness turns into a leaking that keeps on leaking and flips over in a drifting-away. I feel myself slowly drifting away and getting more and more unstable but as instability is impermited all a body can do is watch it being taken away from a body, all its drops, all its last energies. This whole process gives a lot of anxiety. It is not even that I mind being sad, I think I’m always a little bit sad, but this drifting and drifting is what scares me. So many people ask me: “Heyyy! How is it being back? How are you? You want to hang out soon?” All I answer is: “It’s awful, but yes sure.” Like my psychologist wanting me to fill in this questionnaire. “Do you feel sad often? Never - rarely - sometimes - a lot - always.” While I was answering it I just imagined you not even reading the questions and ticking ‘always’ everywhere. Yesterday I was in the train and I got so anxious from all the loud voices and conversations; it felt as if the words were penetrating my body. I decided to put in my earplugs and left them in as I walked out of the train into the station. I was so happy to have discovered this new technique, I felt a lot calmer walking with all the bodies around. The earplugs  were not like those regular ones you get for free in hotels, but a bit more expensive ones that you can use for concerts. Somebody walked up to me and asked if I wanted to take part in a questionnaire. I nodded no, thinking of that if I have to answer always everywhere again I will collapse. I saw he looked at my ears with the strange blue things coming out of them and said: 'Oh, I’m so incredibly sorry, I didn’t see."><br> 34 <br></div>

<div class="box" data-content="The turning point picture you posted reminded me of this cup I bought in the thrift store. Do you remember when we went to that store? The same place where I got that lovely piece of orange/red garment, a good velvet lure for creatures. For me the equivalent for ''Heyyy! How is it being back? How are you? You want to hang out soon?'' is ''Hey, nice to have you back here. What are you doing?'', but the worst is ''Ohhh, until when are you going to stay here?''. I hate this presupposition that I have to leave at some point especially because I know I don't have certainty for a lot of months so it's a kind of enunciation that just accelerates the process of intensification of anxiety. I have to say it's tricky not to fall into the supposed wonders of acceleration and velocity with the clock pointing to two minutes before midnight. In that sense, I feel that the end of this world already happened, it's just sending its virtual affects back into this time that will eventually be actualized. If it's unavoidable, what's the point of being here? I know this goes against all kinds of things we are supposed to support but sometimes it's difficult to enter into this mood or tonality. I wonder, I think for me to live any place there should be a time of compressing and decompressing that takes months, something made impossible by the actual neoliberal regime of distribution of bodies - well, I have to say most of my left-wing friends also have the tendency to believe in incessant work, they're so proud of it, they post everyday on the fucking Instagram stories how much they produced and how much time after their regular work hours they stayed writing (specially journalists that have to work on weekends). Poor them, which reminds me that some years ago I was reading Wilhelm Reich, who is very interesting and had this motto about working and loving, but unfortunately when people talk about work is always the NT approach to it, chronological time, not a time that needs some time itself to rest a bit. I guess fabulation and powers of the false are the creation of time itself, if I'm not mistaken. So maybe, well, i'm not that certain that every minor gesture is fabulation or contain it but for me, yes, and I think it has always been. Some kind of experiential glue is needed in cases of waking up as one person and leaving the bed as another one, which is not so well accepted by the judgemental society that likes to chunk people into an unity that is there to be judged and evaluated. But what if this constellation is not the same as one minute ago? I mean, literally, I'm not sure if people understand that. I remember when I was younger I use to leave notes to the other versions/ghosts of myself, or I should say, a-self, or (a)self, hmmm. The cup that reminds me of the image of the turning point was just tested in the microwave, to make an infusion of dandelion roots, not the best kind of tea and technically not even tea, but they say it's good for kidney stones, which apparently are not very active in my organism right now but I feel they can appear in the future again. It's happening again. I'm not sure if I answered your questions about the I, but maybe? I think so."> <br> Yes ! And just say to yourself something like: on Monday I’ll look for a future again. Now trying to sleep and eat well is just as much part of composing a future. <br></div>

<div class="box" data-content="Not sure if I have a piece of vestuary that I couldn't live without, like your necklace. Well, you could say I use the same boots everyday but I don't do feel that it's a necessity, if I had to use another pair of boots or sneakers it would be okay. What I'm sure of is that some pieces are necessary for certain situations, I would say again it's the patches and the pins. During the book launch on the friday I was using two pins: the Welcome to McDonald's one and the Dougie Jones. Still I think I needed more. Too many people performing their not so interesting appetites (very straightforward ones and situated over a certainty on the success of language). I believe in the failure of the language, as Derrida or Butler would say.

<div class="box" data-content="I guess if you would tell somebody that, always a different self, they would put you in some category of a multiple personalities disorder. But variations of the same are always through and through and not happening on the superficial layer of how skin is often approached containing some self inside in a world outside. For that to experience has nothing to do with mental health categories but with something like paying attention, an attunement. Although I’m not sure about that phrase, maybe better a certain sensitivity. And then I don’t mean sensitivity as if it used in neurotypical situations as a trait of an individual. “Oh you’re so empathetic” but as a sensitivity all around. I was a bit surprised when I first met you to see a tattoo on your skin. If I think of tattoos I get a bit nervous. A note of a moment scares me, but also all the notes of moments that were not made scare me. So it is not so much about a specific tattoo but also about all the tattoos that didn’t come to be there. This counts for all the other events just as much, but a tattoo is a simple example to think about. I guess yours is a bit like the notes you wrote for the ghosts of yourself, or better the ghosts of a self. One of the few things I cannot be without is my necklace. I am still surprised that there is something I feel comfortable wearing everyday. So many clothes or jewelry I have I like one day but cannot imagine having near me the next. Maybe that’s why it sometimes takes hours for me to put clothes on. I love staying in my bed after a shower, first with the towel, but then always losing the towel between the sheets. I stay there reading and writing. And I simply cannot get dressed because I cannot determine my mood or my self, or better a self. Sometimes, or often, everything feels wrong to wear. Except my necklace and towel underneath the sheets. But then always this moment arrives in which being in bed for too long becomes suffocating, I feel myself turning into the grandparents of ''Charlie & The Chocolate Factory'', and I need to move. Like you every morning. I would watch you lying in bed, waking up, watching the boring people on the Instagram, but then suddenly there was this move, you had to move on this move, there was no choice. Even if I asked you to stay, you would give me a short hug but I felt in everything that there was no time for a hug, you had to move on that move. Sometimes, or often, the move was simply a few steps towards the table to sit on the chair and do not much more than “just sitting”. But I felt it was not about what you would do, more about the directionality of your body. A body had to sit, it could not lay anymore without getting too sad and drown in the bed once more.

<div class="box" data-content="Today I went again to the Doggy Café. Basically it's a dog friendly café and restaurant. I just don't understand why that's not the standard of any café. I remember some countries I visited that don't allow the presence of non-human animals inside their rooms. In Brazil the law doesn't allow the presence of animals inside any place that serves food, except if it's a helping animal, like those dogs that are used to help people who are blind. I guess that's one of the reasons I cannot go to Brazil. But actually I was reading that one of the most famous cafés of Reykjavik had a cat and the health governmental agency asked them to not leave the animal inside of if because of the possible contamination of the food. But still, of course I would love to live in Iceland and would go any time if I had a job that paid me in Icelandic Krona, so I guess that's one contradiction. Maybe I just can't go there anymore because my body wouldn't survive a month that kind of environment. Sad but true. Anyways, the dogs were so happy at the cafe playing together. It's the second time I went there and I was the only dogless person/human/creature. All of them were with their respective owners. "Owners", what a concept. In the sense I became that kind of person that doesn't have a pet and keeps borrowing pets from another people. Not sure if I like the word borrowing in this context either, I prefer seeing myself as a polyamorous animal/non-human feeder. I hope that doesn't sound like zoophilia hahaha. Like now, the cat with the collar came here again and ate the food I put for the stray cat. She's in an advantage because the stray cat is super afraid, so if I put the food and she's nearby, the human-used cat arrives instantly and eats anything. I'm thinking of strategies for the food distribution. It's kind of melancholic to think that I can't have a cat by myself, or I can't have a more serious care/feeding relationship (but non-exclusive) with another animal because the idea of the future displacement of myself. I don't know what will be my future after 7 months and I don't want to put this other creature in this situation of having to enter an airplane to be in another place of which I don't know how long I would stay there. Speaking of airplane trips, I decided that my next shopping will include a pair of headphones with noise cancelling. I've been postponing this for years because it's kind of expensive, but it's a necessity. Not many interesting things in this message, no? I feel that it's the change of seasons...New weather patterns emerging."><br> ** Now playing: Dolly Parton - Here You Come Again **

<div class="box" data-content="I feel the waves again, my head is space-y, I wish it was Späz-ey, but unfortunately it seems like the panic attacks will reappear. The future is restless. I really understand the temptation to accelerate everything, if there is no future why not drive at full speed till the velocity distorts even the fabric of its own time?'' I wish I could talk about nice things.
I will try.

Do you think cleaning the house is a way of anarchiving?

For sure !">

<div class="box" data-content="Oh, today I met the landlady and she said during the work they would do to prevent my house from falling apart I can’t stay in the apartment upstairs, because they have no furniture or hot water. She'll rent an apartment nearby on Airbnb instead, which is okay. She's a lovely person and even offered me to have my money back for the next month if I want to stay in an apartment of a friend. I said well, it's better if you rent a place for me nearby for two weeks, and of course she agreed because she's lovely. After the work they will make a huge clean on the house, which will save me some anarchival cleaning time.
It's funny though that my house is risking to fall apart at the same time that my body is falling apart. This quick displacement is the worst case scenario for me, I need some time to feel grounded in a place. I can't see the things and where they are from the moment I arrive there, even some weeks after (I just recently after four months living there discovered that I even have a basement). With this interruption I won't have time to set myself up again to plan what to do in the short future, besides that am I already being killed by the two-week trip to Brazil in December. I guess those little things are preparing me to the absolute death next May if I'm not able to find anything for myself after that. But how would I be able to find anything while moving so much? I guess that's what people can't understand, some creatures do not work or cannot work with the chronological time set up by typicality. I faced death other times but this is the first time I am facing absolute death in a few months. Absolute death could be a concept that cannot be accepted by the idea that we are in a continuum which doesn't separate what is dead and what is alive, but right now the ghosts that inhabit me are wandering around in this idea. I really hope this scenario will change but this state of affairs only makes me attracted to ideas of acceleration, I guess the only aspect that disallows me to fully embrace something like that is the interspecific disaster it could cause for this world (and it's already causing since the first anthropotechnical gesture that created Christ as a human-hybrid figure). I also love how these kind of theories remind me of The X-Files and the hybrids; but I wish we could return to the time when I was a child and conspiracy theories were things that more progressive people liked and not the identitarian-right-wing. Well, I guess this world passes through many phases, so many strata to be excavated. "><br> This confusion is affecting my senses. My senses were always confused in the sense that, you may have noted, I’m very affected by some kinds of smells and colour, like the hate I have for any kind of wasabi." <br> </div>
