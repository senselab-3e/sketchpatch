      Yesterday something from the clothing line fell back into the laundry machine. I have no idea how it even did that. But I saw it happening, I saw my pair of panties fall of the line back into the machine. I should’ve responded to the movement, put the machine back on. Instead I put it back onto the line and let it dry. Now I’m afraid of what will happen next time I wear that pair of panties. It wasn’t ready to leave the laundroworld yet. Well maybe I was just teasing it a bit. You and I were in the snowy mountains last night and that’s where we met the jumping bobcat. We were also in the living room of someone we knew and there the cat lived as well. We found out we had known the cat all along. “Ohh!! Are you the jumping bobcat?! But we’ve met you already.” The living room and the snowy mountains were the same place at the same time. Jumping bobcats make use of portals and we moved along. A bit later we were together again in another living room and there were a lot of people I knew. You were just moving as you always do, just as you felt like doing. But then all the people kept asking me why you did what you did and I had to explain all your moves. I was holding a baby and it kept slipping out of my arms. I was sad that we had left the snowy mountains and were suddenly surrounded by all the questions, you were watching something on the tv about bobcats sliding in the snow. Actually now I think of it, it wasn’t really a living room but instead a waiting room. Who knows what we were waiting for. <em> A non-anthropocentric incorporeal entity that keeps intervening in our daily lives through dreams and hallucinations. As Ludueña (2015, p. 44) says, “this point of view may make it possible to think dreaming without making it the secret guardian of our identitary dreams”. </em> Often I think, what will I write in vrey next time. I can’t imagine of something new, but then somehow somewhere I know what to write. It’s tricky though, how to find writing techniques that open up for fabulation and move away from boring singular points of view. Maybe there should happen some anarchival editing soon. I found this book again that my teacher in art school once told me to read. He used to call me the log-lady, carrying something everywhere everytime no matter where no matter when, caring for it and being cared by it. “You don’t really have an art practice, I would call it instead a practice of living, where you just move and sometimes show us coagulations of those processes of movements.” Actually I thought of the book again because - do you like thingies? - it is called <em> The Things </em>, written in 1965 by a phenomenological psychotherapist. It is a weird book, which talks about the changeability of things. I think I hate it but also love some of the writing. It has been very long since I read it though, I should read it again. It is very fubalotory, but always from the singular human’s point of view and methods accordingly, which just utterly bores me. I can only read it as some Husserl fan fiction. <em> First contemplation. The bar that moved is longer now. Or shorter, it depends on where it moved to, and its surroundings. In any case is a meter here not the same as a meter there - in which the word ‘meter’ doesn’t seem to fit the equation. Because the meter, in the sense of a hundred centimeters, which means a constant, a once and for all captured size, is the proof of the changeability of things. I realise, however, that the meter, just as the things that had to be measured, by their move, changed in length, can keep the word of a meter. I want to remember everything what I considered this day very well. The length of the measuring tape changes with each movement, in the same way as the thing that has moved, the thing to be measured, that thereby, measured by the measuring tape, keeps the same length. With that insight can the line be maintained, that the meter, just as the distance, just as the length, never has the same size. </em> What about translating? Is is a strange kind of writing practice, don’t you think?
