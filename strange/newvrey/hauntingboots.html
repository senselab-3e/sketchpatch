Oi
</p>

<p>
  I went to the foot doctor to get new techniques for nocturnal sleepings in the living room. She let me walk on blue screens to get inkly prints of the way I walk with the forces of this world. Afterwards she felt my feet and let me invent all kinds of turns and bents and flexes. She said my feet were vrey flexible, no surprise they were so tired from walking , can you imagine all where they went to! In order to deal with the forces pressing, my flexible joints started composing bone-like textures. Itâ€™s hard to walk in this world with flexible feet, so no wonder the joints started fabulating, only appearing through blue and bents.
