  It is 26 degrees today, in the middle of fall, the warmest it has been ever since they started keeping track of the weather forecast. People are biking in summer dresses and drinking beers outside. Nobody seems to care that this world is upset; nature is confused, this warmth makes the periwinkle and rhododendron in the garden think it’s spring again. Just when they prepared themselves for winter, the warmth came running through their leaves, stirring with all their sense of season. People don’t mind, they just want to make a tour on their boat and have sex with the doors wide open. Ever since we started talking about where vrey would go I haven’t written so much anymore, maybe because suddenly it’s moving I don’t know how to move with it. I guess I just need to compose with the new rhythms.

  <p>You know the picture asking “Is there life after death?” and answering “Here to discuss it are three dead people” ? It’s a beautiful conversation, too bad it’s still all white dead man though, even the death seems to remain typical. On September 2nd around 2 am I asked a friend that exact question to which he said: Didn’t you send me that image already in an email? Then I looked into my inbox and saw I sent it on September 2nd 2017 at 01:17. We were at the same party back then because of our mutual friend’s birthday; apparently that gathering sparks something reappearing! A blanket said in its washing instructions “wash inside out”, I wonder what that means. Somebody told me she’s collaborating with someone she never met before, and now they’re doing something at the same place for the first time, but still they’ll make sure they will never meet. Somebody else told me that often when I’m talking they have no idea what I’m talking about, but then sometimes suddenly they recognize some words I talked about before and by that they understand what I’m saying just for a brief moment. Makes me want to go there where they can hear grass grow. Somebody told me that poetry in order to exist needs to forever not become itself; always chasing itself out of its own form. Unfortunately, most of the forms we encounter are the ones we’re getting to fill out, perhaps even forming our thinking. When poetry happens - and here you can read anything instead of poetry - it’s going to be unrecognizable because then it is not becoming or chasing anymore, and thereby not happening. The novelty is temporality split into what is ceasing to be and what is in process of becoming. It’s always strange but eventually beautiful to notice something like a change of taste; suddenly loving a kind of fruit. It turns taste into a never-ending question, as long as I’m noticing the change, I will forever chase the taste. Let’s drink some chinotto!
