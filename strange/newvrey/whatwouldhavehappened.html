  Imagine what would have happened to all these words if they hadn’t find there ways into vrey. If vrey never happened! Well, I guess it is only just happening again. A sweet person from my class gave me some Greek cream that will make my feet cold. She brought it from Greece because she had the same with her right hand as what I have been experiencing with my left foot now for two weeks. Can’t be a coincidence, my left foot, her right hand, diagonalizing until we’ll find the edge of the event. I woke up at 6am today, and lay awake until 8am because I couldn’t stop thinking of the dream in which all my pores started to clog again. Those thoughts for some reason moved over in the visits from hundreds of ghosts from the future, asking what I’m going to do next year, next day, next minute, next second. To calm down I read what you wrote here while I was asleep, rocking me back asleep again. Only to wake up again at noon realizing I had missed all my alarms that were screaming “what will you do next second”, “what will you do next minute”, “what will you do next hour”. Rhythm not as a temporal structure, but a continuous assemblage of intensities.
