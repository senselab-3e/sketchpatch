  There's something that attracts me to the tower you posted. And you already know that because I took many pictures of that exquisite building. But I've been searching a lot today and I still didn't find so much information about it. It looks like a water tower, apparently not being used anymore, and I've seen it in many pictures around the city. Only thing I know for now is that it brings calmness, like a place I could run to if the world started to fall apart more than it's already falling. Or a good place to film. But it seems, or it <em> feels </em> like a portal, you enter there and you wake up in another place. I'm not sure whether in another dimension or just with a new perspective, belonging to another species of animal or plant after crossing that threshold. I want to be there, and I want to believe.

<p> Here's an iteration of the same tower in a procedural environment created with a-frame and javascript. It's so funny how it fits so well in this mountain-snowing dark environment. Maybe it belongs to it as well. It also reminds me of something that could come from the <em> Batman The Dark Knight </em> films hahaha.
