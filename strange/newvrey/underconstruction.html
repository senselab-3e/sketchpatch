  Today I moved to downtown for a little more than a week, because my house is falling apart - the underground must be rebuilt. You saw the cracks in my house (look at the picture I've just put) . The workers are going to fix the basement in order to make the building not fallible, they're going to work against the infraworld that is trying to connect with the ground of Montreal. I'm also leaking: I was so anxious that I cut my nails again, too much. Bleeding again. And my new temporary apartment is almost falling apart as well: they're blasting the building in front of mine with dynamite, the street is closed in the direction towards Rue Ste. Catherine so to go to Kazu (which is 60 meters from here) I have to go around the block. Today they performed some blasts and I felt that my whole building trembled. On the other side of the street they're also demolishing! I forgot how this is still possible in Montreal, well, at least only in Downtown. It's so funny because some years ago I did a course of creative writing with a nice Brazilian writer and he said that the most possible genre in places like SÃ£o Paulo or Shanghai is the chronicle, because the buildings appear and disappear so fast there that entire pieces of old brothels, bars and small buildings simply get out of the realm of existence (at least on the way they used to be) in a few days, and only a chronicle would be able to narrate so quickly the daily life stories of those places. Well, I said it was funny but I didn't say why. Here in Montreal I feel like we're ALWAYS under construction. But also that things stay as they always were. Maybe they're not efficient on construction business here, and who needs efficiency, anyways? But yes, I forgot that downtown has other agreements and laws that allow the construction of big buildings.

  By the way, the little screenshot I put some pages ago is a comment for the video with the opening soundtrack of Riget: the lyrics!
