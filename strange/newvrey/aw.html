  I guess this is the strangest place I (tried) to work, after eating the Beyond Meat burger in A&W. I know it has a lot of gluten but I couldn't find forces to move myself beyond that point of Saint-Laurent Boulevard. At least this delicious veggie burger returned. I stayed there, waiting, and waiting. Then finally went to a pool in Montreal. I guess pools are very exquisite time-eaters, they eat time like all the other entities we've been discussing, but differently from the ghosts of the future, that eat both actual and virtual time. Now I feel that my body feels tired but in a nice way, feeling that I spent many hours in a determinate environment. In fact we stayed for like an hour inside the pool, and even didn't do many exercises, mostly jumping. Sometimes the waves of typicality sucked us into doing the "from one side of the pool to another" swimming activity as everybody was practicing. Still. It's 10PM but I feel that it is already 4AM. Don't understand this kind of time sucker that gives the sensorial impression of having all the time sucked but still having time until the body wants some sleeping
