      This confusion is affecting my senses. My senses were always confused in the sense that, you may have noted, I’m very affected by some kinds of smells and colour, like the hate I have for any kind of wasabi. But today I went to the Kazu restaurant line, and I thought, well, I've already eaten here this week, maybe I’ll go to another place. Then I went to the sushi place, asked for a place, took off my jacket and my backpack, but then the smell of the place made me puke. The smell was the same as always, so it's not their fault. But this body is changing. Then I went to the cheap Indian place, which also didn't feel right, something about the distribution of tables and chairs made me feel claustrophobic, but the distribution of furniture was the same as always. Then I decided to go back to Kazu, there was no line, which is rare, so I took it as a sign that I should sit there and eat again the tuna and salmon bowl with the little soup. Now I’m at the café writing this because it's the only thing I can do, not sure if there are forces to do other kind of work today. There were two guys recording a podcast about coffee places in Montreal and they were talking about how great coffee is here because of all the Italians that brought the tradition of good coffee. They emigrated to New York, but then some of them came here, and then there were also other populations which breed good coffee from Africa, Brazil, etc. Well, I don't know until now if I found the conversation interesting or not-interesting, maybe both at the same time?
