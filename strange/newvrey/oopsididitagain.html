  I love the “Oops!” eraser in the spaz. I don’t like erasers in general, they imply some strange idea of cleaning or perfecting. But this one is different, I don’t think anything has ever been erased with it. It just lurks to look at the iteration of the spaz in a way that it could shift any moment, that it was something that happened but soon will happen in another way. It entails both the oops of making it as the oops of unmaking it. The oops still oopsing into the now. Popping the oops. Oops is totally pop, don’t you think? Also, just to be clear, I think a lot of other thingies have the same kind of quality without needing a word to say it. The frog (before it got kidnapped to Germany) said “OopS!” so often! SpLaSh and OOps and pOp are all very duplicitous. Oops, vrey.

  When they started building a new building they got rid of the garden. Then as a slow protest she put 500 tulip bulbs in the ground. The director found out they started growing and told all the builders to move the bulbs carefully. “The flowers are wild” she said.

  - I love it! Let’s take a ride soon! Vrum vrum

  <p>You know the picture asking “Is there life after death?” and answering “Here to discuss it are three dead people” ? It’s a beautiful conversation, too bad it’s still all white dead man though, even the death seems to remain typical. On September 2nd around 2 am I asked a friend that exact question to which he said: Didn’t you send me that image already in an email? Then I looked into my inbox and saw I sent it on September 2nd 2017 at 01:17. We were at the same party back then because of our mutual friend’s birthday; apparently that gathering sparks something reappearing! A blanket said in its washing instructions “wash inside out”, I wonder what that means. Somebody told me she’s collaborating with someone she never met before, and now they’re doing something at the same place for the first time, but still they’ll make sure they will never meet. Somebody else told me that often when I’m talking they have no idea what I’m talking about, but then sometimes suddenly they recognize some words I talked about before and by that they understand what I’m saying just for a brief moment. Makes me want to go there where they can hear grass grow. Somebody told me that poetry in order to exist needs to forever not become itself; always chasing itself out of its own form. Unfortunately, most of the forms we encounter are the ones we’re getting to fill out, perhaps even forming our thinking. When poetry happens - and here you can read anything instead of poetry - it’s going to be unrecognizable because then it is not becoming or chasing anymore, and thereby not happening. The novelty is temporality split into what is ceasing to be and what is in process of becoming. It’s always strange but eventually beautiful to notice something like a change of taste; suddenly loving a kind of fruit. It turns taste into a never-ending question, as long as I’m noticing the change, I will forever chase the taste. Let’s drink some chinotto!
