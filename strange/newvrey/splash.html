  I think I'm going to buy some packs of Cinnamon Altoids from Amazon. It comes in a can just like the tuna/salmon cans for cats. I think I started sleep walking again. Every morning I wake up with my feet hurt and full of blisters. Sleepwalking is a bit like those pictures taken in 1989, don’t you think? I don’t meet the variation of you in the evening so much anymore, because that’s when I’m already asleep being in a different timezone. You know 1989 was the year when Taylor Swift was born, no? But now I started wondering if I even really sleep, or just spend the night walking the corridors. Sometimes you hear someone say “She died of old age” and then I ask “But how does that happen?” to which they reply “The organs were just exhausted” but then I think “If that’s dying then I’m already dying”. Some might say that the only way we know death is as an opposition to life, but since events are never composed of like that, what do we even know. Often you kill me with your beautiful words. I guess there's a sort of connection. I've been waking up with a lot of scratches in my back. Definitely it's not something that my body could do by itself. And I've not been sleeping with anybody. But they really look like scratches, and I also can't remember hurting myself accidentally. But then, what is the cause of those things? I would love to be visited by a creaturesque entity that scratches me. Don't take me wrong, I understand your fear of human entities visiting during the night, but I think the kind of visits I would love to receive is of the non-human type, like the stories from my childhood I've been also describing in Lure of the Ghost. But how to summon them through a non-anthropotechnical bias? I remember very well one class of my PhD supervisor in Brazil, he was teaching Spinozist ethics and specially talking about the fear people have about discussing the concept of God or the point of view of God in Spinoza. Well, it's basically the point of view of the event itself. And calling it god is not a problem, actually I like to call it god to irritate some secular friends that have other kinds, and I would say, wayy more transcendental than any Spinozist god. Anyways, he was talking about that and he told, "well, of course, it doesn't make any sense if you go to candomblé and umbanda (Afro-american Brazilian religions) and the spirit that manifests through you or your guide gives you precise human orientations, and very moral ones, like "do not betrayal your lover" or "take care of your children", bla bla bla. So basically i'm calling forth those interdimensional creatures just making them speak in my own boring human language? That's the opposite of anything exciting for me. I want hos(ti)pitality in dealing with unknown creatures, I don't need to say anything to the cats that visit me here because we communicate through our manifestations of appetites through non-linguistic signs. I guess that's what happened between us, we didn't have to talk humanly to know we already knew each other. By the way, can you believe I'm writing this while on the other tab of my browser I'm watching Brazilian live television, more specifically a soap-opera. I think beside cats, dogs and some relatives, Brazilian television would be one of the things I would miss more, hahaha, nothing that I cannot resolve with my VPN and the right streaming websites. Well but you love <em> The X-files </em> and there are a lot of humanized aliens there. Well, that's true, but there are many humans that have more-than human tendencies in that tv show, including Mulder and Scully. Of course as two creatures attuned to the more-than and sharing mutual interests they would’ve taken the maximum of 7 days to sleep together and not 7 seasons and 1 movie before it finally happened. It's funny that they also talk about <em> The X-Files </em> in the <em> I'm Very Into You </em> by Kathy Acker and Ken Wark. I'm not trying to create a parallel with their work but for me it's impossible to not bring anarchival traces from that tv-show since I both restarted watching it fully from the beginning and following the last season that ended some months ago, which almost everybody hated but I have to confess I loved. PS: I still didn't find a place to install the patch "I believe" with the flying saucer from <em> The X-Files </em>, but i'm looking for a new iron (since you took yours back to the bitch when you left Montréal), and a special t-shirt to place it.
