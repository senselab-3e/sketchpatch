      <em> During a Saturday afternoon I found a typewriter in a cupboard in the attic. I had to get used to write with it, because I had been working on a computer. Some letters worked less well, others got stuck even before they could make an imprint on the paper. But after I while I was completely used to the ticking sound of the typewriter. Even though I had gotten quite agile, I couldn’t imagine writing an entire book on it. My typewriter had found a beautiful place in my bedroom, on the desk where the sun would shine most often. I would write on my typewriter all the time, it was a bit like a diary to me.
  I would stay awake the entire night to type away the darkness. At some point my parents even gave me a special room that was soundproof so that they and the neighbours wouldn’t wake up from all the typing sounds. Whenever I told my friends why I had dark circles underneath my eyes, they were astonished. “Writing?!” they would say “I only stay awake to be on my computer or ipod, but not for some dumb typewriter.”
  Often I felt lonely that nobody understood how I felt. Most of the people got very angry or painted to do something with all their emotions. But I just loved to hear the ticking sounds of the typewriter. It was as if I belonged with the typewriter, it was like a friend to me. It felt like I must have been a typewriter in the past, or maybe a famous writer. Could it be that I had returned to earth?
  In a flash I turned from nine to nineteen years old. I chose, although it didn’t please my parents, to keep writing.
  Twenty-three years old and on a trip all by myself to a different city. I told my parents that that would be the best way to be a writer. I met a lot of new people that were like me: obsessed. Once in a while I sent my parents a letter how I was doing, so I could by doing that still practice my writing.
  Two years later and two hopeless books later that no publisher wanted to publish. My life in the different city wasn’t as I had imagined. Shouldn’t I have done something else with my life? No, I had gotten this far and if I stopped now it would all have been for nothing. I kept on going. Just as in the past I kept on writing day and night. I read a lot and took walks in the park.
  One day I read a story about a young man that didn’t feel like he was in the right time just like me. He found something like a time-stone in an old monastery, with which one can travel to the past and the future. I didn’t know whether it was invented or real, but I was sure that I had to go to the time-stone. In the back of the book there was an address. It was in another country. I collected all my last money and I took the train. The next morning I was already there. The people I met there knew the story and were happy to tell me about the time-stone adventures . The young man went to Italy in the times of the Roman Empire. At that time he wrote the book with the message that he had had a pleasant travel, had arrived, and felt like he was finally at home. He also wrote a question asking the people in the monastery to spread his words so everybody could know about the possibilities of traveling with the time-stone.
  There I was. At the place where I felt like I could travel to a home. With the time-stone. I made one last call. If it made me happy, I should try it. So I went away for a week. Oh, I had such a good time! Finally, I went to the time of the first time-writers and cellphones. It happened, I was there. It was delicious, but on Sunday I had to go back again to the ‘normal’ time.
  Soon after though I went back again. I stayed there for the rest of my time and typed just like everybody day and night away on my typewriter. </em>

  I found this, written on a typewriter, from when I was about thirteen years old.

I used to have an old red typewriter when I was a child. I think I even learned how to type using it, before I had my first computer. I remember though that I had a phase when I liked to write backwards, typing or handwriting with cursive letters. It's not that I couldn't write in the “right” direction, but one day I woke up and thought it would be funnier to write everything backwards. My teachers got a bit worried because I didn't tell them or my parents that I could still write ''normally''. And this “malfunctioning” is medically or neurologically called something like “mirrored writing”. Also I remember writing a lot of things in the air with my fingers, what used to give me a lot of weird looks from classmates or relatives.
