    Strangely I feel something similar, although it goes in the opposite vectorial direction. I am afraid of the visitors I would receive when I go outside. At least in Montreal I feel better about that. I decided to put the cat picture because, apart from being a beautiful creature, it's the kind of nightly visitors I would like to attract. I have to say the ghosts that menace me don't have a right time of day to visit me but they're displaced across time and space.

<p>  Also the image of the cat makes me think about my methods of distribution of food. That is the stray cat that visits me, and as I've said before, she knows I have food to offer her but she's really afraid. And the other cat always eats the food before. I guess that's the problems with all distributions that are based on the FCFS method (First come, first served). At the same time, I would never refuse food to the other cat, but I don't buy enormous quantities of food, so the one that is risked of being without food is each time her. FCFS is always attached to the idea of performativity, I don't mean performativity in an elaborate conceptualized way, but mostly oriented towards the common sense. If there's an opportunity, the performatic bees are already flying around, exhibiting their interests and appetites, while for some that's an impossible feature, or that costs too much for a body. I use FLCL (fabulation)  against FCFS but it seems to me that it doesn't always work, or sometime it barely works. What gives me goosebumps, because there are other selves of myself that I don't want to reinforce, like the accelerated one.
