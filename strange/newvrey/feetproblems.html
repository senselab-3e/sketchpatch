  Since I still can’t walk on my left foot, I started applying some balsem on it which makes it go from hot to cold, cold to hot. The first night I put it on, I only massaged it into my left foot, but it was such a strange sensation to only feel one foot floating that last night I decided to also massage my right one. This morning my feet felt less exhausted, so maybe it helped. It was a strange way to fall asleep, with two feet going from cold to hot, not even in regular rhythms, as if I was drifting away but also a bit like a feetly lullaby. The hot and cold made me at some point not feel my feet at all anymore and instead my head was as a bowling ball beating down the pillow. Feet and rooms haunted by the spectres of any kind of archive, analog, digital - language, colours, stories, images, lullabies, footsteps, filenames, a shared online google docs like vrey, buttons fallen from my favorite coat - traces that still float in the air like pollen. This idea makes me wanna sneeze. I’m allergic to both dust and pollen. Both I didn’t have until an older age. The dust allergy I think I just fabricated myself. I would hardly clean the room in the attic where I used to sleep as a child. Whenever my parents intervened and moved my stuff around I would completely freak out. I couldn’t find anything anymore, all my gatherings of things - a stone on a stack of papers - weren’t there anymore. Instead there were random stacks out of everything, of things that didn’t even want to be together,  so the floor could be vacuumed. All these stacks that weren’t my stacks made me so anxious. I was given the task back again to do it myself, but often weeks flew by where I lost all overview and dust just kept flying around. Dust flying around, most of dust is skin anyways, responding to the fluxes and rhythms of my breathing. The little box with all the extra buttons that come with a new garment, all the extra ones, waiting for a button to be lost so they can come along and hold two pieces of fabric together. After my grandmother died we found out that the largest part of her closet in the bedroom she used for assembling all those buttons. Neatly placed next to each other, all different ones, on two shelves, nothing else than buttons and dust that made itself visible once a button got picked up. There are (as far as I know Christian) practices after people pass away of covering mirrors and stopping all the clocks in the house. I think also windows and closets were often covered up with sheets until after the funeral. It is to keep the spirit of the deceased from getting trapped into this life and make it able for them to smoothly cross over to the other side. If the soul of the departed saw their reflection, they would be trapped and not able to move to the afterlife; with the possibility of them haunting those who remained in this life. Stopping the clocks would keep them from worrying about time, and for the dead person to begin a new period of existence without. Also, when the dead person leaves their home it should be feet first, so they can’t look back as they’re passing the door. Leaving feet first, bit like my feet stopping with walking and shifting from hot to cold making me float in bed. It would be nice to stop all the clocks in my home. It reminds me of that one time a person I met seven years ago in Paris, and I found absolutely irritating,  asked if he could stay in my home here in Amsterdam for one night. I thought, why not, maybe he turned out nice in those seven years. They say in seven years’ time all your cells are renewed anyways, so my expectations were not even that unlikely! He got here, oh and I first have to tell you that he works as a data analyst at some sort of big chemical factory and he has to predict when parts of machines will break down so they can in time be replaced. From the moment he stepped into my apartment he fell into one big pool of stress. He saw that everything in my house is a bit ‘broken’, I would say instead, wobbly, or funny, or stubborn, or working in a less neurotypical sense of what productivity is. He immediately started analysing everything and fixing things. He noticed that all the clocks were on a different time and started synchronizing them. The one near my bed does for every minute forward three minutes backwards for example, but no, he thought it should do one minute as the sixty  seconds which he believes to be a minute. At some moment I yelled: “Stop! I like it this way, everything works beautifully and makes me happy like that. I don’t need aligned tickings of time, I love my slow bedside clock, ticking backwards as the room walks on.” Stopping clocks one at a time, covering all cabinets one step at a walk. The sheets slowly accumulating all the dust in the room, to make sure that the particles - read presences- don’t crawl into the cupboards. Dust that was just mostly skin anyways. I started sleep walking again, I started sleeping with the big soft living room for the first time, practices of sleep haunting my days. Dust is ineffable, making me want to jump into all its particles and discover whatever is speaking. Every gesture a question, to which the adventure responds according to its bent. Reunions like gatherings with all that disappeared for a little or long while. Constant correspondences that only want to express processes of growth and causation; how to write with these horrible languages in a way that doesn’t repeat these trajectories. <em> The appeal to agency, in other words, is a corollary of the logic of embodiment, of turning things in on themselves. To undo this logic is, once and for all, to exorcise the spectre of embodied agency and bring things back into animate life. As a bundle of potentials in an ever-unfolding field of forces and energies, the body moves and is moved not because it is driven by some internal agency, wrapped up in the package, but because as fact as it is gathering or winding itself up, it is forever unravelling or unwinding, alternately breathing in and out. </em> (Tim Ingold) Makes me wanna beat out a rug, run through whatever it leaves behind, and sneeze as hard as I can. Oh some skin of the dead got caught up in my nose! Literally a leaky corpse accumulating with all the other skins; skins of the furniture, of the bodies, of the room, of the rugs, of the television screen, of the curtains, of the neighbour’s cat, dancing around on the dusty bed sheet covering the closet making sweaty shelves.
