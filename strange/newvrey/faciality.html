    I was browsing Instagram stories again. Maybe that's the most toxic thing I do, besides cutting my own feet to relieve the absent presence of the ghosts of the future. A proud mother everyday showing her prodigious little girl playing the piano, going to manifestations, swimming, wearing a princess dress, learning English, everything focused on her face with a blur filter. Some people on a party, faces with logos, faces smoking cigarettes, faces smiling, faces with their 'partners’, faces watching Netflix. Faces, faces and faces. It's kind of sad that people understand faciality only referring to their human all too human faces. Then I stop instagramming, go look for grants to feed the ghosts of the future. Can't find anything, go back to Instagram stories: faces doing live videos explaining the importance of (... I can't even remember), faces drinking, faces celebrating the weekend, faces eating a vegan pie with gifs of faces around the food. Only human faces of course. A girl who is learning to play a tambourine with her face painted, a boy showing his new beautiful haircut. I go back to search for grants, maybe even a new PhD, everything needs an interview, more frontal conversations feeding the ghosts of the future. No future and no past, I feel that those human faces live in a non-time, sucking energy, creating vortexes that suck all my will to live. Then I watched that little film again that Godard did in which he's joyfully browsing at full speed the pictures of his phone. I don't remember if there were many humans there. Maybe I should watch it again. But I assume he's laughing because he's already 90 years old and is leaving this world soon, ‘what the fuck is this world I'll depart from soon? Hhahah’. But I hope that doesn't happen, I don't want Godard to die (maybe only some of his fans). I guess people call that a lot things, the spectacle, for example. I'm not sure what to call all of this, I just want to meet creatures with no faces or faces that are not over the neck, maybe that's what made me so happy when the airco-guy visited me for the first time (and until now, the last).

  <em> If it is possible to assign the faciality machine a date- the year zero of Christ and the historical development of the White Man- it is because that is when the mixture ceased to be a splicing or an intertwining, becoming a total interpenetration in which each element suffuses the other like drops of red-black wine in white water. </em> (A Thousand Plateaus, p. 182)
