  I  guess that the question of the ghosts have been changing a bit for me since my childhood. I always expected the ghosts to visit me even not believing in any kind of Western or Eastern formalized religion. But also - and it's something I wrote in the introduction for the book I’m finishing to write and I'll send to you to review - my early childhood coincided with the release of the first seasons of <i> The X-Files </i> broadcasted on television. If I remember well it was released in Brazilian free television almost at the same time it aired in the US, which was uncommon. Cable TV was still not very popular there. But anyways, when I started to watch <i> The X-Files </i> as a little child I became fascinated with the idea of the abduction by external forces that were either extraterrestrial or cryptozoological - well, yes, there were some episodes that tended to more spiritualized cases but they were not my preferred ones.Every night I wished to be abducted by one of those creatures and be tested, examined, etc. But when I realized that some creatures or ghosts could be very human I understood that I wouldn't like those so much. Well, I guess there all kinds of specks of ghosts and extraterrestrial beings. Including the ghosts of the trauma and repulse to neurodiversity that inhabit São Paulo. I guess that's why the only way I go back to Brazil is for visiting parents and cats. Also it makes me feel really sad that conspiracy theory right now is so oriented to the right-wing, my whole infancy was built with fabulation with <i> The X-Files </i>, <i> Twin Peaks </i> and other TV shows with all sorts of conspiracy theories and that's what made me survive, believing and creating, fabulating a world in order to survive the burden of living with people. Even that they stole from us, remember Dr. Amp in <i> Twin Peaks: The Return? </i> I guess I'll continue to my fabulation even if that means being judged by the alleged “politically activist” people that still don't accept any other kind of contract or agreement that doesn't pass through the discursive neurotypical bias. People think they're ontologically superior to animals, yes, and they still believe that they really overcame transcendentalism with their secular faith: for me any kind of ontological division is a kind of secular-masked old system of belief or faith. But I have to confess sometimes I have so much disdain for the humans that I may put them on a lower level than the other creatures, including animals and plants. Well, I guess everybody has its contradictory tendencies (fortunately).
